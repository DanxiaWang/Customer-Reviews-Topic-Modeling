5,6,6047800,Laurie,5,Great compact printer,I was looking for a small printer to take with me on trips. This fits the ticket perfectly. I’m 68 yrs old and not that savvy with electronics. I got the printer going I no time. I did read through the online Manuel. I printed two images from a flash drive and one with WiFi from my IPad.,3 years ago

7,8,6047800,Ethel,5,Mother’s Day gift,"We bought this for my mom for Mother’s Day. She isn’t good with technology and it was easily set up for her to be able to use without difficulty. No computer needed for setup. Just connect to wifi, or use the printers own WiFi to connect your device to. Very easy setup and very easy to use. Great picture quality and fast.",1 year ago
8,9,6047800,eurob,4,Very nice quality color pictures.,"This printer is pretty amazing. The pictures are very good, colors are very nice. I'd choose this over a Polaroid camera. Works very well with my android phone (Pixel 3) because Canon has a great app to make the printing process very easy. Printing from a computer however is a bit more difficult in that the WIFI setup is not so easy. If you have a WPS button on your router it might work. I didn't have that but was able to set it up manually via the interface on the printer. But my computer still didn't see the printer as a new wireless device. I had to connect via USB cable which worked fine. It's also super easy to insert the cartridge and photo paper. Make sure to buy the correct paper that works with this printer. Other formats will not work. Very happy with this product.",1 year ago
9,10,6047800,Rita,5,Great Photo Printer,"I was looking for a photo printer & all the ones I found only printed 2x3 pictures & I wanted one that printed 4x6 pictures. I found the Canon Selphy & it doesn’t disappoint. I was able to put my memory card in & choose the pictures I wanted to print out. I haven’t read the instructions yet to see what more I can do with it, but it was real easy to use. The one thing you have to be careful of is not to touch the glossy part of the paper because the ink will stick to the oil that comes from your fingers & you’ll see it on the picture. This printer is easy to use & very compact. There is also a place in back for a battery pack that you can buy from Canon to make the printer more portable. I’m glad that I made this purchase.",2 years ago

If we don't use it for months there is no worry of ink drying out.  Its an awesome printer and great software on line via your phone apps.  awesome videos on line and it way better than all the small HPs.  Quality is surprisingly good.

18,19,6047800,Charles,5,The little printer .,Excellent photo printer that produces true quality images with actual ink not like the other  Polaroid style printers. I had a little bit of a delay on setup with my WiFi but once I got past the setup it was smooth sailing. Be sure not to put the printer up against a wall because the paper scans back and forth through the printer. Out the front and out the rear. Very easy to use with the canon app.,1 year ago
19,20,6047800,Clyde,5,Be sure to get the correct Selphy paper!,"This is a great 4x6 printer, but be warned that it does not use standard 4x6 glossy photo paper. It takes special Selphy paper and ink, Canon RP-108. I purchased standard Canon 4x6 photo paper, Canon PP-301, but it unfortunately does not fit the Selphy printer. Because we opened the paper package before we discovered that it does not fit the Selphy cassette, we cannot return the paper so we now have 100 sheets we cannot use. The information on line from Best Buy and Canon is not clear about the need for special paper. Once you have the correct paper and ink, the printer works like a charm.",3 years ago
20,21,6454281,WyldeBlue,4,Typical decent inkjet print quality w/nice add-ons,"PROs:

- Compact, low-profile all-in-one with minimalist design tucks away unassumingly in a corner of your desk/home office--ideal for students/family light-duty printing
- Simple, fast, almost idiot-proof setup--PC-based app (HP Smart) provided full-screen, animated graphical guides for loading paper, installing ink cartridges, aligning print heads--everything was up and running inside of 5 minutes
- Despite being a budget inkjet with no fancy full-color display, the printer still manages to offer informative and ""family-friendly"" status updates via various LED indicators across the front (purple--network setup, orange--maintenance/printer open, green--power up cycle, white--ready to print) and printer tones/jingles to indicate things like power-up/down, print job finished, successful setup, etc. 
- Despite its low profile, HP managed to squeeze duplex printing capability into the ENVY 6055e so you don't EVER have to futz with figuring out which side and which end goes up to get perfectly-aligned, high-quality printing on both sides of the page
- Text quality is especially good; lettering is crisp and well-defined even on mid-tier quality settings
- Includes 6 months of free HP+ ink service--great for people who like to do all their printing in full-color at high quality; automatically orders/delivers replacement black and tri-color ink cartridges based on usage--after 6 months, costs vary between $0.99 per month (15 pages/mo. with 45 pages of rollover) up to $50 per month (1500 pages/mo. w/4500 pages of rollover)--$4.99 monthly for 100 pages is supposedly the sweet spot for most typical small family use providing hassle-free ink replacement that never requires a trip to the store
- HP Smart app allows printing from smartphone regardless of location; there's even an option to delay the output until the printer senses your phone is within Bluetooth range if you want to keep your printing jobs away from prying eyes
- Thoughtful usability design for ink cartridge maintenance; color-coded ink cartridge slot lids (light-purple and black) help ensure you don't accidentally load the black cartridge into the color cartridge slot
- Finally, a budget flatbed scanner that provides decent optical resolution without needing software interpolation: 1200x1200 dpi hardware optical resolution natively matches printing resolution as well (although color resolution can go all the way up to 4800x1200 depending on the source file's resolution and paper loaded in the tray)
- Copy quality from the scanner glass was surprisingly good--copied output of an inkjet photo page was virtually indistinguishable from the original
- HP Smart app provides a large, easy-to-read and easy-to-navigate tiles and menu pages for accessing and adjusting functions like scanning, photo printing, creating arts & crafts templates/pages, creating ""Shortcuts"" to automate repetitive tasks (like scanning receipts and uploading them to Dropbox), and settings adjustments for resolution, color, paper type, etc.--it's a nice, ""family friendly"" interface that is easy and relatively intuitive to use, much more so than Windows own settings pages
- Although there is a USB port on the back if you want to go with a wired solution, this printer can be set up and remain in operation without EVER connecting any wires to a PC...definitely a plus if you plan on placing this printer in a central location away from a host computer
- Swing-out paper collector at the end of the paper output tray was a neat design touch--allows the guide to tuck away when not in use to keep the printer's footprint down to a minimum
- The printer automatically detects when you raise the scanner cover to load an original onto the scanning glass--this illuminates the copy buttons on the touch-panel display as well as a HUGE digital copy counter; repeatedly pressing one of the copy buttons advances the counter to the number of copies you want to make 

CONs:

- Like most inkjets, this printer struggled to produce large, smooth patches of black--ink banding was clearly evident even in smaller fields of solid black backgrounds (the printer did fare a bit better with multicolored backgrounds, however)
- Like most inkjets, plain paper output was only adequate with stippling pretty visible within the images--it's fine for draft copies, a quick photo on the fridge, or something that's otherwise likely to be disposable, but if you want to keep the output for the long haul and really see the colors pop, you'll need to invest in some higher quality photo paper
- Despite the claimed near laser-jet printing speeds of 10 ppm B&W and 7 ppm color, the average printing speed that most people will probably use (the printer's default or a middling ""set-it-and-forget-it"" print quality) was actually pretty sluggish--in our testing, mid-tier print quality for a single page of mixed text and multiple images took about 27 seconds
- Power management is a bit of a mixed bag. There is a setting that can be adjusted for reduced power consumption (sleep) after so many minutes, but if you use the printer in wireless mode, you cannot access the auto-power off function. This keeps the printer's main LED (above the paper output tray) illuminated at all times. During the day this isn't a big deal, but in a dimly lit room, the white status LED and the blue wireless icon on the touch panel display can get a little bright. If you keep this printer in the same room where you sleep, the LED might even be intrusive during the night
- The two copy buttons on the touch panel, one for color and one for black & white, are identical, save for the fact that the color button slowly changes color, while the black & white button remains lit in a single color. However, the color copy button changes colors relatively slowly, and the black & white color button looked more yellowish than white; there also are some times where the color button's LED is the same color as the black & white LED, even if just for a few moments. It's not a big deal, but it could create a little confusion over which control does what, especially for those who are less technically adept or simply don't take much time to commit the button layout to memory 
- Servicing the printer/changing ink cartridges was a trickier proposition than it probably needed to be. There is a single slide hinge/support in the upper right that keeps the cover locked open while you service the components inside, but opening and closing it seemed to take quite a bit of force. There is no catch-lock or locking button to engage or disengage the hinge lock at the back; the printer simply snaps open or closed by manhandling the cover. The action is not very smooth and I was afraid at first I might actually be damaging the unit due to the force required to get it open. And because the printer is so light, it was pretty easy to slide the unit around while I was wrestling with the cover in the first place. Once you get used to the force required to open and close the lid, it's not so bad; but a smoother mechanism would be more reassuring.

Bottom line:

For a budget all-in-one, the Envy 6055e actually has a lot of nice features and user-friendly design touches that make it pretty well-suited for a typical student's or small family's light-duty printing needs. The connectivity options, physical design, and user interface feel well at home within a modern connected household, and it is doubtful many users will experience difficulties navigating and utilizing the many functions and capabilities the Envy provides. The inclusion of a 6-month trial of the HP+ automatic ink cartridge reordering program may be attractive to some people depending on how much ink they typically consume, but I imagine it will be of some value/comfort especially to those who routinely print LOTS of full-color pages while running their ink tanks down to a nub, but also detest having to go shopping for more ink (or remembering to do so in the first place). Text print quality is very nice while normal quality graphics and image reproduction are adequate, but nothing much to write home about until you step up into specialty papers and high-resolution DPI settings. So long as you're not expecting archival or showpiece-quality photo reproduction, the Envy 6055e is a solid multi-function inkjet printer for the price.",7 months ago
21,22,6454281,APFLORES413,4,Great printing with frustrating set up.,"I was curious to how the new Envy 6055e printer would work. The 6 months of Instant Ink was an immediate draw for me as I do have a lot of printing needs for my home office and for my kids homeschool work. That means we go through so much paper since I don’t want them looking at a screen for too long, so I would need to print their assignments and readings. The 6055e seemed like a great choice and again, the 6 months of Instant Ink was a big contributing factor for me to choose this item. 

Once I removed the printer out of the box, I was struck at the overall size of it. It does seem like a scanner/printer from the late 90’s/early 2000’s. The area that this would cover is rather large compared to all the other 2-in-1 printers out there. Setting up was rather confusing as the 6055e is wireless and does not connect to your home WiFi. Instead, it has it’s own WiFi built in and you connect your device(s) through the HP Smart App. I am familiar with this app as I already have a small HP Photo printer. When powered up and following the initial steps, the printer prints out 3 pages for the Start Guide. I was a little dismayed that you would need to print 3 pages for something that I felt should have already been included in the box. Oh well, so I printed this up and it tells you how to set up with 3 methods: Mobile device, Computer, or Printer’s Control Panel with WPS. Setting this part up should not have been hard, but for some reason my iPhone was having issues with connection with the printer. I finally was able to get the app working and then a fourth page was printed up, and that had the Printer Information Repirt which included the Printer PIN # in order for me to complete the set up process. This was getting ridiculous, but after this, everything else was smooth sailing. 

Using the app is a great addition as our home has become a tech hub.You can check on the status of your printer via the app, and check on various tabs to help enhance your printing experience. Instant Ink is available, as well as easy helps (Fax, Print Photos, Print Documents, Camera Scan and Printer Scan). If you run into issues with your printer, there is a Get Support feature as well. Collecting all of these features into a single app has been very helpful in de-cluttering your Home Screen. 

When looking at the 6055e, you are met with this rather sleek looking device. Underneath the lid, right above the paper tray, the printer emits a glowing light similar to a Ceylon from Battlestar Galactica or the front light of KITT of Knight Rider, but changes color every second. This was a nice touch but rather annoying if you have this in your room and it’s time for bed. There is a small control panel to the lower right of the device that includes 6 icons: Information, Cancel, Resume, Copy, Power, and WiFi. Behind the printer is another power button and a WiFi select button. 

Printing was a joy. You are able to print double-sided and almost to the edge of the page. I test printed a Peanuts cartoon and it left about 1cm edge on all sides. This would be rather useful if I wanted to print up pictures. The printing process was speedy and not too slow. 

Despite my issues on initial set up, this printer is a joy to use. I just wished it was not so large. I am looking forward to utilizing Instant Ink in a few months.",7 months ago
22,23,6454281,Txstatesal,5,Printer from the Future!,"I have had my Envy for under an hour and i'm already looking through my phone for which pictures I can print. Luckily before I got my printer I got some photo paper in case I loved this printer. 

Right off the bat i'll tell you it is amazing to have a printer where I do not need to get on a computer to set it up. This set up was beautiful and simple as can be. It was pretty because the printer is basically walking you through the health of it's setup through these glowing pink, purple, blue, and finally white glowing lights. It is so futuristic looking that I was enamored with the lights and sat there just in silence. 

It is probably the thinnest printer I have ever owned that will help all of the family and it comes with a scanner. The scanner lid is a bit flimsy and scares me since we have some high trafficked technology here that can be handled with tough love but we'll survive. 

All you have to do is download the application, and at the click of a button the printer sets itself up, let me repeat... ""the printer sets itself up""! So once you've plugged the printer in, it walks you through what it needs you to do and the printer does the rest for you. 

We are living in amaizing times when I don't need to download a driver off the internet, open my desktop and set up the printer. 

HP I am in total awe, and I have wondered where printers like this were for years so thanks for making this such an easy and sleek piece of technology to compliment my office. 

I almost want to take everything back out of the printer and restart the setup so that I can watch the magical light show it does for you when you set it up. 

Definitely going to be helpful for me and my family as we maneuver through work from home and distance learning this coming year! Oh and one final thought, take a look at the test page with all those vibrant colors. I have had printers that promote bright and vibrancy but never hold up. This was a part of the set up printer test and it is very clean, bright and crisp!",1 year ago
23,24,6454281,JKinSYR,4,Great looks and fast printing,"One of the best inkjet printers that I've ever used. This is a great all in one machine to print, copy, scan, and print photos. 

I really like the look of this printer on my desk as it looks like something that is modern and contemporary without looking like I work in an old office building. The white color of this printer would fit in any home office setting as it's a great unit for a household. As a home office printer I can print my work documents easily and quickly. The kids are able to print out worksheets and assignments from computers and tablets. As a family we are able to print out our photos conveniently at home and the quality is very nice. 

Setup for this printer is easy to do as the HP Smart app walks you through the process with ease. One thing I like about this printer is that it can connect to the 5G wifi setting within my home, as previous printers never offered that capability. This printer can print effortlessly with wifi printing from my laptop, iPhone XR, iPad. This can be hardwired to your computer if you need, but honestly I find the wifi seems to be much more convenient for everyday situations as we have been running this printer regularly. This printer takes the HP 67 ink cartridges. I'm not a fan of the way that HP locks their proprietary ink cartridges and doesn't allow for less expensive generic cartridges to work on here. 

The pages print quickly, and quietly. There is a nice soft glowing light that accentuates the printouts and serves as a monitor for what status the printer is in. It's definitely a modern day printer that would suit most homes for convenience. HP offers the instant ink subscription program which could be helpful for some, but I am not a fan of buying a device and then having to sign up for a subscription program in order to use the device. Seems like a nickel and dime move but it seems to be the way of the future unfortunately.

PRO:
Easy setup
Good looks
Good print quality
Print from anywhere

CON:
Ink subscription program",1 year ago
24,25,6454281,xKing,5,Great for the home office!,"This is a feature rich, compact, fast printer. Print quality is awesome, sharp lines, vivid colors, especially on the special photo paper.
Printer supports a wide variety of connections - HP ePrint, AirPrint, Google Cloud Print, BLE, Internet Printing Protocol, TCP/9100. Whatever you printing source is - this device got you covered. If you are working from home and your VPN software causes you troubles - you can always use Printer's internal WiFi ""Direct Print"" to connect and print without disconnecting from your work VPN.

Setup is super easy, just power printer on and then use HP ePrint app on your phone, follow directions. Printer will print out a special calibration sheet that it will ask you to scan in order to adjust the printing heads perfectly. That's it! All home computers will recognize the printer automatically.

Note that there is no hardwired ethernet port so WiFi connection is mandatory.

This printer supports HP instant ink which is an interesting subscription based ink delivery model (this is totally optional, you don't have to sign up for it if you don't feel it would be beneficial). You just print what you need (and keep loading paper :) HP will automatically send you ink cartridges, you will always have a fresh set standing by. You pay for amount of pages you print monthly, starting from $2.99 per month (or about $36 annually) for 50 pages per month with up to a 100 pages rollover! No commitments - you can cancel any time. For me this is a perfect option as I don't have to remember to buy cartridges anymore.

There are, of course, more advanced settings available - just use your web browser and navigate to printer's IP address - you will be greeted with a nice web interface and a lot more advanced options such as SNMP, different Wireless settings, etc.

I would definitely recommend it for a small/home office if color print is desirable and you don't need anything bigger than letter. 

Note on scanner - it's just a flatbed, there is no autofeed for the scanner.",1 year ago
25,26,6454281,RebelHips,3,Work from home worthy,"I'm using this while I work from home, and for the 10-15 pages I print a day, it's fine. It doesnt print super fast, and I've been going through ink cartridges quicker than expected, but I love the Bluetooth connectivity and it's low profile. Two things I wish I had paid more attention to before purchasing: The scanner is manual fed. Which means I have to physically put every individual page down to scan. Sometimes, I have a stack of 20 documents to scan and it takes forever to do it! An automatic feeder would have been great. But even worse than that is the blue light that NEVER TURNS OFF! I have this printer in my bedroom and it's really annoying. It's BRIGHT. All that being said, it fits my needs just fine and was right in my budget.",10 months ago
26,27,6454281,VangTfz,5,Excellent compact printer!,"This is a great compact printer! The footprint of this printer allows it to sit just about anywhere in my office without being noticed, and when you do notice it, it looks very minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing!

Setting up the printer was very simple. I followed the steps provided and used my Samsung Galaxy S10+ to download the HP Smart app to connect it to my Wifi network. Adding it through my Windows laptops & desktops was also a breeze as well. Able to print from my mobile devices, laptops, and desktops! The print quality is also top notch. I printed some 5x7 photos and was very happy to see the detailed quality.

Overall, i would definitely recommend this printer if anyone is in need of a small printer with great print quality!",1 year ago
27,28,6454281,KKCNIck,4,Good Printer overall for school/home needs,"Pretty standard printer with a few nice perks. I can see that HP is clearly setting up a more streamlined process of owning a printer. It comes with a toner replenishment service and support you can actual reach someone on. Also the setup uses your smart phone which is nice since most users these days do not have the traditional desktop they did in the past. 

Pros: 
1: Scans easily and fast
2: Prints crisp for an inkjet
3: Has many other functions that are able to be used via mobile device
4: Includes better than standard warranty

Cons:
1: Ink is slightly expensive to replace after trial period
2: Printer interface is sluggish when using via the mobile device to print.

Overall, I would purchase again for the needs of school/home usage if I did not want to deal with ordering ink cartridges or risk running out.",7 months ago
28,29,6454281,rmoran,4,Buying a new printer,"My HP ENVY 4520 I have had for a very long time and it finally went out on me.

He talked to an Associate and asked for a HP ENVY and they gave him this one. I like it, it works great it's I am 63 and new technology needs to be simple. I know on the 4520 series they had a display so I could see what was happening or not happening. This one just has invisible buttons on the side.

34,35,6454281,ProductiveGreen,5,The Envy of HP,"After visiting several stores and physically seeing HP printer options I decided to visit BestBuy online. I'm glad I did because this printer is exactly what I needed (Print, Copy, and Scan). Plus it's wireless. I can literally print from anywhere. I love the fact that my printer has a dedicated email address. So if I need to receive a hard copy of any document,  I can simply provide someone with my printer's email address and the document prints directly on my printer. I've even printed notes from my cellphone's Samsung Notes App.

My HP Envy is connected to multiple devices (Tablet, cellphone, etc.) and performs functions seamlessly.  

I signed up for HP's Instant Ink which provides me the confidence in knowing I will never run out of ink. Affordable printing plans are available to meet my printing needs. Moreover,  my printer automatically orders my ink cartridges. 

I know my ink levels before printing and whether I'm low on paper.

HP Evny 6055 is perfect for personal, office, and even family use. Whether it's printing, copying,  or scanning  in black and white or color. Whether it's a simple doc, or contract,  or even a color picture,  my HP Envy 6055 performs well.",1 year ago

I finally discovered that the black wheels inside arrived at an angle. It seemed correct since they were tight however after some persistence to fix this error, they tell you to pull up the blue piece to check wheels for paper, while that is open, I managed to press the whole wheel mechanism down more into place so that the black wheels were no longer at a slant (mostly the right side was up too high.) They should be level along with the blue handle, which also arrived at a slant. Hope this helps the next person who encounters this problem on a new, out of the box printer.",1 year ago
41,42,6450663,billr920,5,Network Reliability,"The printer connected to my network immediately. All devices sent print jobs with no issues. I also used the HP app to finish set up. Printing speed is decent. The email function works good. HP has also stepped up internal security for this printer for better performance. The touch screen is very nice, has good response to touch. There are audibles with different uses. The printer acknowledges when a sheet of paper is inserted into the auto feed and the touch screen responds. Color tone Is good, but not fantastic. I consider this to be more of a great office use printer. There is no SD card slot. It does have USB, Ethernet and Fax Ports. The paper feed tray works better than previous HP printers that I have owned. I would have preferred a more rounded edge designed housing, instead to me, It looks like a big square block and very heavy. Over all I think this is a very good printer, has been very reliable so far. HP offers 300 pages per month printing for the first few months at no charge when you sign up for the instant ink program where you choose a set price per month to receive ink as needed that will kick in when the initial period ends. I would recommend this especially if you need a work horse.",2 years ago
42,43,6450663,SirGalahad,4,Does it all,"SETUP: 

Setup was relatively simple. Once you install the ink cartridges it will notify you that you need to install the HP Smart App to finish up. You can use your cell phone, tablet, or PC to do this. I used my Smartphone and it connected to the printer via Bluetooth and then I was able to setup the wireless from there along with everything else. It walks you through all the steps to finish up including a few optional ones. By doing this you also get a year extended warranty (for two years total) and you have 7 days to sign up for 6 months free of HP+. Which is a neat program explained below. Overall, I had no issues with this part of the setup or getting things to work.

I then tried to setup the printer to my PC and ran into some issues. Again, the application is required to get the printer to work which is a bit frustrating. The application had a hard time finding my printer and it wasn’t until I rebooted my printer that my PC was able to find it.

BUILD QUALITY: 

This printer is large, and you’d expect it to be heavy, but it isn’t. Which can be considered a pro or a con. The entire thing is made from plastic (for the most part). But I didn’t notice much creaking or issues and in general it feels solid and well built. The trays feel alright and I would prefer them to be a bit more solid and smooth. The touch screen works better than my previous printer and is a bit more intuitive, but I still think they could improve the OS to be better as it is still clunky and doesn’t feel like a modern device. But that is me being picky.

SPEED/PERFORMANCE: 

They report that it can print 20 pages per minute of normal documents and 10 pages per minute for colored documents. Scanning appeared to be quick. I don’t have a phone line, so I didn’t test the fax. The legibility of the text that is printed is an 8/10. Since it comes with multiple ink cartridges (blue, yellow, _, and black) the colors also look good. But I found that images had a bit of blur to them. This improved with higher quality paper. But if you are wanting amazingly crisp print jobs I’d keep looking. Overall, the performance is right where I’d expect for this price point. I didn’t find it too be too loud. There is also a quiet mode which takes longer to print but reduces overall noise.

HP+:

You have 7 days to redeem 6 months free upon completion of setup. The maximum number of pages you can get per month during the free trial period is 700 pages. It allows you to choose a specific number of pages you plan to print each month and then charges you a set amount per month for it. Prices seem reasonable. If you don’t use all your pages, it can roll over into the next month. They only send out ink (with free shipping) when the printer itself registers it is low, so you are never out of ink. They also report that this is cheaper than buying retail ink and that it comes with more ink, so you refill less often. You can decide if that is just marketing or not. This entire service can be a pro or a con depending on how you feel about signing up for yet another monthly subscription to something. But I’d imagine if you are someone who prints a lot that this would be greatly appreciated, and you’d likely save money. 

FEATURES:

As indicative of the name it is an All-In-One Printer. Which means that you can print documents (1 sided automatically but 2-sided if chosen), scan documents, and fax documents (if you have a phone line connected). You can also print either from your PC or from your phone/tablet. I printed multiple things from my phone and PC without any issues.",8 months ago

The size is perfect for a home office or home print station (SOHO) compared to a large office AIO. The HP Officejet Pro 8025 is a very capable AIO as well, printing, copying, scanning and photo printing performed brilliantly for a package this size. The 8025 will perform well in a small office that has less demanding printing jobs. Have connected the printer to all our home devices and will use as a backup to our larger HP AIO office printer if needed.

Photo Printing knocked my socks off, lovely rich colors and definition of a ceremony picture we had taking of our kid. Very nice.

Panel 
- Flip up design for easy viewing, nice.
- Bit small but adequate 2.7” Touchscreen.
- Easy navigation – full explanation on downloadable user guide.
- Tap on the “?” on the home screen will bring up a help screen which includes “How to Videos”, to cool.

App
- HP Smart assists you in the setup, scanning, printing, sharing, and managing the HP printer. Share documents and images simply through email, text messages, cloud and social media services, i.e. Google Drive, Facebook, iCloud, and Dropbox. 
- Android app is full featured for printer management.
- Printing from Android, Chrome devices and iOS.
- Google drive printing - kid loves this feature for printing school projects/papers from home or school.
- Supports Print from Anywhere.

Networking
- Almost to simple to add to network. Windows 10 PC’s can scan the network and install printer and launch app if you want.
- Connections: 1 Ethernet; 1 Wireless 802.11b/g/n; 1 RJ-11 Fax.
- Was the simplest, easiest and quickest network setup of any printer I have used.
- 
Full feature faxing (with contacts) scanning and copying capabilities.

Paper capacity is impressive for small office printer:
- Paper handling input, standard 225-sheet input tray, 35-sheet ADF
- Paper handling output, standard 60-sheet output tray
- Legal paper
- Envelopes
- Photo papers
- Double sided duplexing 

Monthly duty cycle 20,000 pages
4 print cartridges (1 each black, cyan, magenta, yellow)

46,47,6450663,VADarkstar,1,A Clumsy Vending Machine For Ink Cartridges,"Everything about this printer is an embarrassment for HP. 

Physically, it is noticeably larger than HP printers with similar printing capabilities from years ago. 

The paper tray is quite small (especially for business printing) and HP has redesigned how you load papers into the tray - it is wholly unintuitive. 

Above the paper tray is an extending plastic platform designed to automatically reach out to catch your printed pages so that they don't shoot out onto your floor. Even when I printed the initial alignment page, this mechanism failed to engage.

There are no ports on this model for memory cards to print from. Admittedly, this is not being marketed as one of their photo printers but I don't understand how documents from memory cards are not part of office printing necessities. 

During setup, this model immediately identified the included ink cartridges as official HP ink cartridges. A little bit of research alerted me that this printer will only accept genuine HP ink cartridges. 

It will not allow you to print in black ink alone if your color cartridges are empty or are not installed. 

Scanning, faxing, copying, and printing times are average. Nothing stellar. Document printing and color printing (including photo printing) are average. Nothing stellar. 

What does work? Their instant ink program - an ink subscription service (their ""Ink Of The Month"" club). Everything about their service is well defined and clear. 

But in an new printer era where they will need to compete with other printers with HUGE non-cartridge ink reservoirs, please take a look at the size of the cyan cartridge that fits this printer in the attached picture below. 

For a machine that is clearly being marketed as a source of ink cartridge sales, you can find other models with more or better features for WAY less money. 

There is no way that this can be an economical purchase for home or office.",7 months ago

52,53,6450663,Batlacit,5,Smart Printer for a Smart Office,"Let’s be honest: most of us see printers as a necessary evil at the best of times. They’re not only complicated machines that can break in a multitude of different ways, they’re ones that are often essential for us to get our jobs done. Fortunately, manufacturers know this, and have been diligently working to make smarter printers that can automate the more annoying steps associated with getting them to work, while also being easier to maintain. The OfficeJet Pro 8025 is one of the latest offerings from HP seeking to make printing a pain-free process, and while I can’t say that they’ve entirely succeeded the progress they’re making is certainly encouraging. 

The first thing I noticed getting the printer out of the box was how nice and clean the lines are. While it is a full multifunction device they’ve opted for a very minimalist control layout with only a single swing-out touchscreen providing controls and no visible lights or status indicators. It’s a welcome change from HP, whose aesthetic has often leaned towards a much busier look with an abundance of complex curves and physical controls. Given that my printer lives in a corner of my living room so that everyone can share it, the fact that it looks nice and doesn’t immediately draw attention to itself is a definite plus. What I like even more is the fact that all the controls and readouts you’d typically expect from a working printer are still there. Status LEDs are set behind the white front paneling of the printer, and are bright enough to shine through the material when they’re on while being completely invisible otherwise. And the touch screen, while small, is extremely accurate when it comes to resolving where you’re tapping it. 

Setup was about as painless as it gets these days. Once I had it out of the box and plugged in, instructions appeared to guide me through the initial setup process and get me set up with the mobile app which I used for all the fine detail work, such as joining it to my local network and set up my trial account for the Instant Ink service, which is basically a consumer version of the sort of service contracts you might find in offices where you pay a small monthly fee based on the expected workload for your printer and ink cartridges are sent to you whenever the printer reports that it needs them. From there I was able to print from my cell phone immediately and start setting up the various apps that the printer comes loaded with. Setting it up on a PC was sadly a bit less painless. These days Windows generally tries to automatically install any new printer that appears on a LAN to spare you from having to set it up manually. It tried to do the same here, automatically configuring it to print through HP’s ePrint + JetAdvantage service. The interface worked, and it found the printer, but I couldn’t get it to successfully send a print. Fortunately it was pretty painless to install the printer manually for a direct connection, and once that was done it worked perfectly.

That said, one of the nicer features of the printer is the fact that by using its built in apps, you don’t even really need a computer. You can connect directly to your google account and print out anything on your Google Drive it can recognize directly from the front panel. The more security conscious among you (as well as anyone with kids) will also be glad to know that they thought to include a PIN requirement to make sure not just anyone can do this. The system works well, and while I can’t say I expect it to be the way I regularly print stuff there are times I expect I’ll be making use of it. And then you’ve got the SmartForms – one of the standout apps for the product. This is one of the cleverer ideas for a printer app that I’ve seen, allowing you to quickly print out a variety of useful forms and templates on demand. There are some obvious ones like a fax cover page or a weekly agenda (linked to a google calendar account) but what I found particularly appealing was the fact that it can quickly spit out graph paper, lined writing paper (in various forms even) and even games like mazes or sudoku grids. As someone who has regularly run out of graph paper in the past, I can definitely see myself using this feature on a regular basis. 

There are still a few lingering issues and areas for improvement. There isn’t a native app for OneDrive to start, which is somewhat unfortunate as that’s where I store the work stuff I’d probably want to print without a computer. The interface for the apps isn’t always very clear either. It took me a while trying to print graph paper before I realized that just clicking the “print” button doesn’t do anything until you first tap the preview image it gives you to confirm how many copies you want, and there were definitely a few times in the settings menu where I felt that a slightly larger touch screen might have been nice to have. But overall I’m extremely pleased to have a printer that’ll spit out graph paper on demand and order its own ink for a change!",2 years ago
53,54,6450663,12182020,4,Printer,I love this printer is so easy and convenient small but perfect for any space i love that I can print stuff from my phone I definitely recommend this printer to anyone I’m so happy with it.,8 months ago
54,55,6450663,KansasMeddlingMom,4,Good for Personal Use and Business Office,"The HP- Office Jet Pro 8025e, Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer with 6 months of Instant Ink Included with HP+ in white was delivered well packed, see pictures of box and packed contents within the box. This low-profile, auto document feeder printer's measurements allows the user easy placement whether that is on the corner of a desk or in a bookshelf/bookcase. When unpacking the printer, be careful to follow the instructions that are mostly pictorial following along in a numerical series. Remember to get all the blue tape that holds down and protects various outside and inside printer parts.

Once you have loaded the ink cartridges and the paper in the cassette, go ahead and print a Printer Status Report that summarizes numerous diagnostic and status items. The next thing to de is load the HP Smart phone app, which I already had done with a prior HP purchase and installation. So I used the smart app on my phone and followed it meticulously to install the printer, however, I wanted to use this printer with one of my office desktop's and using the phone app did not fully install all the functions that I wanted to use. Since the printer is in a different room than the desktop that it is wirelessly connected to, I wanted to be able to use the LCD screen to scan to my computer, as well as, use the app within the HP program for this printer to initiate a scan from my desktop, too-be able to scan from the desktop computer or vice versa, to be able to scan from the printer to the computer. 

In my case, I was having trouble getting the printer to scan to the computer from the LCD screen, it kept referencing to download the 123 HP app and download software. I then called the toll free number and the person that I worked with, sadly offshore but still competent,, asked permission to access my machine to see what was up. At first they just tried to update, but that failed so we had to uninstall and then re-install the software and the drivers for this printer. Once we did this, I was able to scan from the LCD screen, as well as, start the scan from my desktop using the app loaded on my smartphone and my computer. 

The only function that I have not tried is the fax, but that is because I already am using a different fax machine that I really like. However, I confirmed with the tech guy that it I do want to use the fax function it needs to be more rings that the answering machine. So, in my case the answering machine picks up at 4 rings and the fax is currently set up to pick up at 5 rings. I have not turned on the fax yet, but have used all the other functions. 

I have mentioned that I am a CPA by trade and have brought and installed this printer in my office to use. So, my practice is very heavy in tax and I started using this office jet printer to print some of my clients' returns and the ink quality is excellent-very crisp and bright, easy to read. However, I still believe that if you are going to print lots of pages, then the laser jet would still be the better choice than the ink jet because there are many more printable pages on a laser jet cartridge. This HP 8025e says that it has fast printing speeds up to 20 pages per minute in black ink and 10 pages per minute in color. I did not take out a stop watch to confirm that, but like I said above, the black print came out super crisp and clean and the color is fresh and distinct, and even so with the color print. 

Lastly, I did sign up for the HP+ plan which will provide you with free ink for 6 months. Going forward, I did sign up for the HP+ plan. They say that the warranty will be extended from 1 year to 2 years, that I will receive free ink for 6 months, but in return for that you do need to set up an account and link a credit card to that account. It took about 7+ days to receive the ink, sent for free by USPS, providing me 700 pages of ink even though the account that I initially set up will be 100 pages of ink, I know that HP wanted us to comment on this, but I cannot since I just got the replacement ink a day or so ago and have not yet needed to install the new ink to see if this printing machine accurately and properly communicates to HP when I need additional ink. I do not know what the lead time is before HP, I guess automatically initiates another ink shipment and if that is accurate based on usage and shipping time. In fact, I plan to call HP and see what the process is and I will update this review once I get that information. So, the plan that I have initially set up to pay for is 100 pages per month at, I believe, a cost of $4.99 per month. However, I have not loaded the new cartridges yet since my initial ones are not out, although with printing tax returns the black cartridge is getting a good workout right now, but I cannot comment on how intuitive the printer is to contact HP when the cartridges are at a certain ink level and then trigger the ordering, mailing, and ultimate receipt of the new ink cartridges. 

Oh, one last thing for you to be aware of, so when I had to call HP to get the program properly installed so that I could either scan from the machine or the LCD screen, I asked about the warranty period and the man that I was on the phone with, Iren, told me to send my proof that I did not receive around early or mid February. I told him that date was impossible because I did not even request that printer that early. He sent me an email for me to attach my proof that I had not received the machine until March 30, 2021, by scanning the FedEx delivery tracking history receipt.",7 months ago

I bought this printer in attempt to (hopefully) switch all of my printing for my graphic design business from third-party to in-house printing (a much better choice overall). However, this printer failed over and over and over. 

I've had it about a month and I should've taken it back immediately once I knew, but I gave it a shot and it failed. I've tried printing with every possible setting on the printer, changing my computer settings, printing on different types of paper, printing with PDFs, PNGs, the whole 9 yards and it's still extremely sub-par, especially for the price. 

The ease of printing is nice, but the quality is what matters to me. I could've purchased the $49.99 epson printer and gotten the same results. Extremely disappointed that I wasted this much money. 

I attached a photo of a sticker I tried to print. It should be nice, solid blocks of color. Instead, it looks like it was done with watercolor. It's extremely splotchy, and messy. I've never had a printer print this terribly before and I haven't the faintest idea why this one is doing it. For me, this doesn't come within the realm of acceptable.

60,61,6470013,Kotor,5,Perfect for Home Use,"This Epson multifunction color inkjet printer, scanner, and copier is perfect for home use. Once connected to a wireless network, printing from any device connected to the same wireless network is quick and easy. The print quality is superb, and is much better than inkjet printers I have used in the past.

The setup was very easy and took about 20 minutes. The first step is to download the Epson app.The app seamlessly walked me through the setup process by providing step by step instructions. Next I filled the individual ink tanks with the corresponding ink color using the provided bottles. If you are concerned that the process of pouring the ink will be messy, don’t be. Epson made the process as easy as can be. All it takes is opening the cap, and placing the ink bottles upside down on the nozzle above each tank. Then wait about 2 minutes per bottle for the ink to drain into the tank. I was able to hear the sound of the ink draining, and the fill line will show when the process is done.Remember to not squeeze the bottle, it drains on its own and automatically stops when the tank is full. Epson has also made it impossible to fill the wrong tank with the wrong color, by shaping the bottle nozzles differently. For example, It is not possible to pour magenta ink in the black ink tank because the bottles only fit the proper tank.

The next step was to use the app to locate and initialize the printer and connect to my wireless network. Once connected to my wireless network, printing wirelessly is as easy as pushing a button from my laptop or wireless device. The printer was recognized by my Windows and Chromebooks, as well as my Apple and Android devices and phones. Virtually any device on my wireless network can converintly use this printer. This is a very useful feature because most people spend as much, or more time, on phones and tablets as they do on PC’s. When called to service, the printer takes less than a minute to wake up and print. The print speed is slightly quicker than your average inkjet printer.

The LCD screen is large enough to easily read and use. The copy and scan functions can be controlled using the control panel on the unit, or the app.

A nice advantage to having a wireless printer is that it can be placed anywhere in the home that is convenient or where there is space. It is also equipped with a USB port for wired connectivity.

Epson really thought of everything with this unit! It features excellent print quality, flawless operation, and the projected print page yield from using ink bottles over cartridges is many times greater.",3 months ago
61,62,6470013,Dakingindanorf,5,A Good Value. Innovative?,"My biggest gripe with home printers is their lack of innovation. I feel like the tech in the printer my parents had growing up is pretty much the same that you’ll find in nearly every “new” printer on the market today. You pay for spendy ink cartridges and get mediocre prints from a device that isn’t particularly fast and looks like a plastic block. I appreciate what Epson has done with this printer to at least try to shake things up a bit. Functionally, the ET-2850 is like most home office printers - it connects wirelessly, prints, and scans. However, there are two very notable features of this printer that make it stand out:

#1: The Epson Smart Panel app. Aesthetically, it’s nothing special, but functionally, it works REALLY well. The app walks you through the setup of the printer with clear instructions and pictures. While it takes awhile to do the entire setup process, I truly believe anyone could do it. The app lets you play with photos, documents, ID cards, scan things directly to your phone, access printer information like ink levels, manuals, and so so much more. I’m in my late 20’s and up until now, when I’ve needed to print something, I have always printed from my desktop. This is the first printer, largely due to the Smart Panel app, that I feel confident printing to from my phone or iPad. I can edit what I need using the app and feel confident that it’s going to come out right the first time, every time. When documents print, you also have the ability to select/ deselect two-sided prints. Nice little feature that saves on paper. I’ve always had to manually print, flip, print again to get things to print on both sides of a page. 

#2: You guessed it - the reloadable ink tanks. This may be the first really good innovation I’ve seen in a home printer since...well...ever? Each tank holds nearly all of the ink that comes in the included bottles. The black bottle is 127 mL and each colored bottle is 70 mL. For reference, high capacity cartridges average 16 mL of ink. This is significantly more ink than cartridges, which means you’re going to be refilling significantly less often, throwing away less plastic, and of course saving money in the long run. The tanks on the printer are easy to refill with an “auto stop” feature. Refill cost is comparable to cartridges. But remember, you’re getting more ink and refilling far less. At Best Buy, you can get all three colored ink refills (cyan, magenta, AND yellow) for $41.99 and black ink refills for $19.99. If the ink lasts two years as advertised, we’re talking about $30/ year. My one concern with the tank system is that there are tubes and I assume pumps that bring ink to the jets. Being a newer system, I hope that longevity isn’t an issue. TBD. 

It feels a little weird getting excited about a printer, but Epson really did a nice job with this one. Up front cost is a little higher than most, but I truly believe that cost will be made up with ink savings. If you’re in the market for a new home printer, definitely consider this one!",2 months ago
62,63,6470013,Hmirza,4,PRINT TILL YOU DROP!!!,"The Epson EcoTank ET-2850 is an all in one solution that allows to your print whatever you may like, in color or black and white, without worry about running out of expensive toner and also helping save the environment. The Epson Ecotank included ink bottles will allow you to print almost 6500 in black and white and almost 5200 pages in color, that is a little over 500 pages of black and white and a little over 400 pages of color a month. The EcoTank ET-2850 is the perfect printer to satisfy your print needs for home, school and even work from home. Let’s go over the features, and PROs and CONs of the Epson EcoTank ET-2850.
Setup: The setup process for the EcoTank ET-2850 could not be any simpler. In the box you will receive the printer, power cable, black, yellow, magenta, and cyan ink bottles and instructions on how to setup the printer. The EcoTank ET-2850 is a wireless printer, so it has built in WIFI. To setup the printer you would need to download the Epson Smart Panel app. Once the app is downloaded all you need to do is click “+” on the top right corner and the setup process begins. The printer is automatically picked up by the application and will guide you through the rest of the process. You will need to fill the tanks with the appropriate and included ink and then it runs through about a 10-minute ink initialization process and after that you are ready to print.
Features: The Epson EcoTank ET-2850 is an all in one solution. This is a printer, copier and a scanner. You can print wirelessly and it has a flat bed scanner for scanning and making copies. The scanner has a scan resolution up to 1200 x 2400 dpi (Dots per square inch), for high quality and detailed scans. The printer has a print resolution up to 5760 x 1440 dpi, allowing you to print high-quality photos. The EcoTank ET-2850 can print black and white pages at the speed of 10 pages per minute and about 5 pages in color. This printer can also print two sided pages at the speed of 6 pages in black and white and 4 pages in color per minute. This is a rear fed printer, so instead of a tray for your plain paper, there is a slot in the back where you need to put the paper with a capacity of 100 sheets. This printer has a pretty compact design so it will not take up much space on your desk.
PRO:
***Cheap Ink*** - I was able to find the compatiable replacement ink on Amazon for about $20 for all 4 bottles. (Generic Brands)
Easy Setup
High Quality Scan
High Quality Print
Wireless Printing
Compact Design 
Two-sided printing 
Easy refill ink 
Cut down on toner cartridge waste

CON:
Small Display – 1.4 inches – Although is it comes with a color display, the display on this printer is rather small, its somewhat difficult to see any clearly.
Slow print speeds – 10 ppm in black and white 5 (Single Sided)
 6 ppm in black and white 4 (Two-Sided)

Overall, The Epson EcoTank ET-2850 is a good all in one solution for any of your home, school and work from home printing, scanning and copying needs. I have been using this printer at home for kids school and some of my office work and it has worked great. The scans and prints came out crisp and clear. I do wish that the display on the printer was a bit larger or even completely remove the buttons with a touch screen display and I was not a big fan of the print speeds but the quality of the print made up for the speed. All in all, I would recommend the Epson EcoTank ET-2850 all in one printer.",3 months ago
63,64,6470013,Harrkev,5,"Expensive, but a great printer. Economical","There are three printers in this series, and I am reviewing the mid-tier option. This is more expensive than the ET-2800, but it does NOT offer automatic 2-sided printing. It is up to you to determine if the extra cost is worth is. There is a considerably more expensive ET-4850, and the main difference is a paper tray cartridge and a sheet-feeder on the scanner.

Well, on to this printer: It uses GIANT bottles of ink that look like they should last for a while. Because you have to dump this ink, setup is easy and mess-free, but takes several minutes to empty the bottles. The bottles are keyed so that they will only fit into the proper tank, and a viewing window on the front of the unit tells you how much ink you have.
As to installing drivers, this takes a while, and there are a few ""feedback"" options that you should uncheck on the first screen. Aside from being a bit slow, the install process went without a problem. It has a USB connection, but I opted instead to use the WiFi connection. It appears to be 2.4 GHz only, but that is acceptable for a device like this.
The print quality is quite good. You have the option to balance quality vs. the amount of ink used, and the results look good. There is also a 2-up option. One disappointment is that there is no actual paper tray at this price, but up to 100 sheets sticks out of the top-rear of the unit, making it look awkward. To get the paper tray you have to step up to the high-end unit.
The scans look good, and the software allows you to scan straight to a PDF file (nice touch), and even add more sheets for a multi-page document. This is a feature that I really appreciate.
The only real problem that I had was when I was printing a double-sided document. One page got jammed (probably my cat's fault) and I had to clear the jam. The printer SHOULD have re-printed the jammed page, but it did not. Other than this, performance so far has been flawless, but I have only had the unit for a few days.",2 months ago
64,65,6470013,techsta,4,Good print quality and economical ink tanks,"I currently own another Epson EcoTank printer so I know how much money you can save using this technology. I needed another printer and selected this one because of its footprint and white color. It is an attractive printer.

Set up was very easy using the instructions in the box which direct you to download the app and then follow along as it guides you in how to fill the ink tanks. The process is simple and the bottles did not leak any ink.

The connectivity to our network was quick and easy and I was able to start printing quickly, The print quality is very good.

I like the fact that the paper loads from an upright position in the back. That allows te printer to be placed close to the wall which is exactly where I planned to put it.

Overall, I would say that this printer does everything it advertises it can do. The only drawback for me and the reason I do not give it 5 stars is because it does not support Chrome OS. The main reason for getting this unit was to connect to a Chromebook and many Epson printers do support Chrome OS, but this one is very new and it does not yet do so, according to the Epson website. I hope they will fix that in a subsequent firmware upgrade. For now, it works with the USB connection for that tablet computer.",3 months ago

67,68,6470013,Lsmachado,5,Happy with purchase so far,"Really like this printer. It’s compact and lightweight, and really like the white color instead of the usual boring black. Setup was a breeze using the app on my iPhone. Took about 20 minutes, including filling the ink tanks and initializing them. I didn’t even have to enter my WiFi password. 

Print quality is fine for my needs, since I rarely print photos. The gigantic ink supply is the best thing. I got so sick of having to buy ink every time I had more than a few pages to print. The ink cost for my old printer was nearly the cost of the printer itself, and it came with ink when I bought it. Go figure!

The only con for me so far is that I haven’t been able to scan a document from the printer dashboard itself to my iPhone or iPad unless I use the app from my device. The only option there is to scan to a USB connected computer or laptop, which I no longer own.

I did learn one tip on YouTube for dull colors or lines through the copies. You have to make sure that the paper type you select on the printer is identical to the paper type selected on your computer or device. It definitely made a difference for me; the colors were definitely more vibrant. Also, I did purchase 2 reams of Epson Bright White Pro paper. It’s great - a tad heavier than other copy paper. I think it’s worth the couple of extra dollars over the regular copy paper.

Only time will tell if the longevity of the printer justifies the higher cost. I like that you get a two-year warranty with online registration. Right now, I think this was definitely a worthwhile purchase.",2 months ago

Graphs, reports, and illustrations print with ease. This really is a quality all-in-one. Setup is easy and painless, taking about 15 minutes. Ink bottles are mess-free and so easy to use, you’ll wonder why no one invented this decades ago. Very small form factor that easily fits in a home office setting or a living room without looking like it’s out of place. App is easy to use and responsive. Really you can’t go wrong with this and it’s so much better for the environment than buying dozens of cartridges.

Highly recommended for busy moms, work-from-home businessmen, and students with lots of reports.",2 months ago
71,72,6470013,Honeybee,4,Simple and lightweight,"Very simple to use and lightweight, about 12 pounds. Set up was super easy, and the ink reservoirs fill up in less than 90 seconds each. No more messing with cartridges and figuring out how to recycle them. There's enough ink in the bottles to top off the levels after initial set up.

The only problem I'm having is connecting to my Wifi, but I was still able to print wirelessly from my laptop.

It would be nice if it had a USB port like the similarly priced model that was on display, but it's not a deal breaker.",2 months ago
72,73,6470013,The34Car,4,Solid Light Use Home Printer,"There isn't anything too special about the Epson EcoTank ET-2850 but it seems to be a pretty solid printer after several uses. My favorite part of the printer is its Epson Smart Panel companion app for Android. This app makes printing from my phone super easy. From my phone I can do all sorts of different print types; from photos and documents, to access to Google Classroom and creative prints.

Filling the ink tanks is straight forward and no-mess. This printer uses refillable ink tanks instead of ink cartridges. I don't have a preference either way with cartridges or refillable tanks, but supposedly you get more bang for your buck with the tanks.

Connecting to my Android phone for the first time was also easy and smooth. I had a bit of difficulty with getting my pc to discover the printer for wi-fi printing, but was able to get it done in the end.

The printer is quiet. Standard copies are decent enough, albeit not the sharpest. The high quality print setting does have much better clarity however.

The printer is white, although the power cord is black which I thought was weird. It's a basic looking printer so it's not going to win any design awards. The paper tray is the kind that sticks up from the top of the printer. I much prefer the look and space savings of paper trays that load underneath, but it's fine.

This printer can also be integrated with Alexa and Google Assistant for voice-activated printing, but I doubt I'll ever use that feature.

All in all, I think that this printer will last a long time and keep everyone in my family happy with easy printing at home, and I'm happy with it.",3 months ago
73,74,6470013,elzeus,5,Economical printing for the masses,"The Epson EcoTank ET-2850 printer is a great all around printer. It features an ink tank system that allows for a large amount of printing but that also features none of the pitfalls when compared to other cartridge based printers. The setup was a breeze when using the smartphone app and it also promoted me to do a firmware update. The printer is quiet and quick as well as decently compact when there is no paper in the top paper feeder. If you are looking for a paper tray that goes on the bottom or an Ethernet connection than this is not the model for you, look for the Epson ET-3830 as that has both of those features. Another tip I can give is to make sure you remove all of the blue pieces of tape before doing the setup and if the ink is not emptying into the tanks then try to reseat the bottles or lift them ever so slightly (you should hear the air chug into the bottle as the ink drains). Overall I'm very pleased with the Epson ET-2850 and look forward to printing many new projects with it.",2 months ago
74,75,6470013,Embalmergirl,5,RUNNN to get it!,"I read through all the reviews before buying. Since I homeschool, I needed something that will stand up to hundreds of pages without needing new ink. So I bought online and had it delivered. Delivery was faster than expected. Now to the printer.

This is better than I expected. The ink for refilling the entire system once I will need it, I priced locally at $58 for all 4. My last printer cost $36 for just the black and the printer itself had only cost me $75. Since this printer holds so much more ink, I love this. 

I have not printed pics, as this is really for business and school work. So far I've printed just over 100 pages and the ink barely went below the fill lines. The pages are clear and crisp, no matter how much color or grayscale is used. Since some pages I print are for coloring, this is great for a kid who is just learning to color inside lines. So I expect at this rate based on ink used, I should easily be able to get 1000 pages in before needing to order new ink. My last printer, I was luck to get 100 black and white pages, or if I did color, maybe 125. So I'm super stoked about this so far.

Set up took about half an hour or so. I really didn't want to have to get yet another app on my phone but it was required. After putting all the info in, filling the ink and letting it set up, I just had to print a page to check. After the initial set up and all the printing it required, the remaining ink in the bottles was just enough to refill all the way back up. I printed a test page and was happy. 

The only issue I've had at all with this printer is a paper jam. While printing 30 pages out, in the middle it decided to jam. All paper was inserted correctly but it just didnt want that one piece to make it past..Oh well, easily fixed. Pop the back open and pull it out. Except it wasn't that easy. I did pop the back open and followed directions on the screen saying what to do. But there were tiny pieces stuck inside. So I had to fish those out. Took maybe a minute. Then hit the button to let the system know it was fixed, turned the system off and back on. It started printing again right where it left off.

Overall I sincerely love this new printer. Maybe not brand new to the scene, but new to me. The fact I won't have to buy ink every 30-45 days is great. Total up front cost was a bit high, but maintenance will be so much less than my older, cheaper printers were. Great buy.",1 week ago
75,76,6470013,Ace254687,4,Good printer,"The biggest problem with printers are the ink refills and how they can cost so much, with the Epson Ecotank ET-2850 they managed to solve that problem. 

This Printer is an all in one inkjet, it can scan, copy, do photo prints, 2-sided prints and it comes with a 2 year supply of ink (you read that right, 2 years). This printer even comes with the software installed on a CD, something you never see anymore, and much appreciated. Setting up the printer is very easy, you have 3 options, you can use your computer, you can use your phone or tablet with the Epson Smart Panel app, or you can use the printer itself viewing the small LCD display. 

Once everything is set up, you can either use the epson app to print documents, or photos, or you wirelessly print from any device that has internet connection. I first wanted to see how well the printer works with photos, so I loaded some glossy photo paper and used the app to print some test photos. The app automatically applies an auto enhance, no matter how well the photo looks – whenever you print. This resulted in my photos being way to bright and oversaturate. So, I went in and turned off the options. The results weren’t all that better to be honest. I found that this machine prints photos where the colors are either way too bright, or way too dull. Needless to say, I wasn’t impressed with the quality of photos. 

I tried printing regular document and and graphics on plain paper and the printer was able to do a fantastic job. I like the ability that this lets you load 100 pages at once, and it also does 2-sided printing as well. The documents came out very clear and in no time at all. The printer is also very compact, so it doesn’t take up that much space on your desk. The best part about the printer is the ink, and how much ink can be stored in the tank at once (2 years worth). The refills of the ink are inexpensive as well. 

Overall, I think the Epson Ecotank is a great printer that saves a ton on ink. It eliminates the need for cartridges and just uses ink bottles to refill the tanks. The printer is fast too, it can print in no time and the print quality is fantastic. My only complaint is the photo quality prints, those can come of very dull and over saturated. Other than that, this is a great printer and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new printer.",2 months ago

77,78,6470013,Buffalorose,5,Love it,"I love this printer. It is compact, but loaded with ability. There was a quick start guide and I followed the instructions and downloaded the app. The app gave very clear instructions on how to fill the cartridges which was a totally new concept for me. That was easy. I like that you can physically see the ink levels on the front. My old all in one was larger but didn’t do anymore, and as far as I can tell, nothing better than this Epson ET2850. My chief complaint for the Epson, and it is important, is that the screen on the printer is very small and the print is TINY and very dim. This made it very difficult to input my WiFi password during setup. Other than that, setup was very simple. Once I got my password in, it found and connected very quickly. I downloaded the app to my iPad, iphone and my husbands android. They all connected very easily. I did not find the same app available on the Microsoft store for my laptop. There was an older Epson app that works just fine. I will look again to make sure that I didn’t miss it. Another feature that I liked was a creativity app that lets me do some nifty designs. So far, I’ve printed a few documents and one photo just as tests. Everything looked great. I can’t speak to the print speed, but compared to my prior printers, it does very well. This Epson seems to “play” better with more devices with less proprietary obstacles than the old other brand printer. I didn’t have to set up an account to do things that wanted to do as my other printer did. So far no passwords required, except for my own WiFi. That being said, I’ve only begun to play with it. The picture I printed was only on plain paper, but it rendered perfect color with no adjustments. If it offers the ink life it promises, then it will be a huge improvement over my inkjets. Sadly if the ink really does last a year, then I could never do a timely a review. I can say, because I can see the ink levels, that the pages and full page color photo that I have printed have NOT lowered the ink at all! In the past, because I’m cheap, I worried every time I printed something. Not anymore! I love my new printer.",3 months ago

79,80,6470013,zboot,5,Great Family and Home Office All-in-One,"The Epson EcoTank ET-2850 is a inkjet printer/scanner/copier which uses refillable ink cartridges. So rather than buying a replacement cartridge, you buy ink bottles which are presumably cheaper. The box claims to come with up to two years of ink with replacements being of equivalent capacity. Opening it up, you get a decent weight, around 12-15lbs, printer that is mostly a rectangular block. It's a bit easier to move around as there really isn't anything sticking out at a strange angle when packed up. You will have the tray that holds paper post printing that's out once set up on a table. Looks-wise, its basic but that's a good thing. Small color LCD on the front with touch sensitive buttons which you'll pretty much only use to set up wifi. It's pretty simple to navigate the menu on the screen and I didn't notice any hiccups with the input.

Once configured, I ran off a couple black/white and color test prints from my phone. The black/white pages were relatively quick, maybe about 6 seconds each. The color took about twice that long. Print quality was pretty good. I'm mostly printing office documents and shipping labels. Others at home may print things with color typically aimed at children and so a color page from a kids book also came out well. I then tried a color photo print which while it was pretty good, by comparison to an actual pro photo printout of the same image, I could tell the difference. On normal paper, the print from the ET-2850 was heavier and not quite as high resolution. Still, I was pretty pleased and from a distance looking at a wall, say 6-10 feet, the quality looks about the same with the only noticeable difference being slightly different color tone.

One thing that's nice which this printer supports is automatic two-sided printing. My previous printer is manual duplex and while I told myself that it's not a big deal, the times that I do need to print on both sides, it can be a pain to work through the order and side in which to reload paper if there's more than a single page that I need to be double sided. So, my advice, if you even anticipate double sided printing once a month, you might as well get a printer which can handle it.

Copying/scanning goes through the tray at the top. Copying you'd likely just initiate through the screen on the printer. Local scanning is not as convenient as honestly, you'd likely just have this be wireless only, rather than connected to a computer. For that, you'd make use of the Epson iPrint app to scan to your phone. You can also set things up for email though using the app may be better from a security standpoint, not to mention it's just easier to share however you wish once it's on your smart device. There was nothing special from the scan/copies. You can tell the duplicate is from a scan. Some black/white documents you might get away with scanning or copying with nobody noticing if they don't have access to the original. That said, the scanner does a good job and while scanning a single sheet is slower than using an app on my phone, it ends up being faster to do 3 or more once you factor in the time not spent trying to avoid shadows, lining things up, and then still doing minor post-processing on the scanned document.

In summary, I think this is a decent, all around family printer/scanner/copier. It could be nice to have a feed tray for scanning (so I could load multiple pages to scan at once, rather than one at a time) but that's not a deal breaker. Time will tell regarding ink costs but assuming the estimates are accurate, I think home office users will be pretty happy as well.",2 months ago

We went to the store to see the printer options in person and this was one of the few that seemed sturdy and well made and so we did a quick comparison for features and decided to buy it.  The setup was a breeze, immediately connecting to the internet via phone and computer.  The print quality and color seem perfectly acceptable.  The scanner works, put I need to access this feature from my computer with an HP app called Scan and Capture.

Ever since I bought the printer, which was a little over 4 months ago, I have not been able to print anything decent. First of all, it does not even stay online, keeps disconnecting from wifi randomly (I had to reconnect it at least 100 times since I bought it) and trust me when I say, it's a pain to connect and reconnect to wifi. When I am finally able to reconnect it and print something, the print is either cut off, barely visible, or a blank sheet is printed. It's not because of the ink (the ink cartridge is full). I checked the websites, other videos and even contacted tech support but nothing happened. I have used hp products before, my previous printer was the officejet series which worked perfectly however, this product is totally useless to me.",8 months ago
107,108,5234375,TickedOff,1,WORST printer EVER...,"I purchased this printer to avoid taking up space (I had a large, older model HP printer with a scanner and it takes up a large part of the desk).  It is small, but the print quality is HORRIBLE. According to the printer, it is aligned and working well, but my pics will show the results I get. Even when it prints out the ""printer data"" that comes from the printer (and therefore does not rely so much on connection to the computer) it cannot print everything. 

I was able to print a letter to someone, but after 5 fails, I switched it to B/W only, and that was the only way it would print! I'm still trying B/W only, but this is what I get... You cannot read anything. 

By the way,  the ink cartridges are new and the printer says they're full. The first day I received the printer, it printed ""okay"", but after that, it has failed me every time. How can anyone use this thing? It feels like junk, and it is junk. I guess I'll have to go back to my big, lunky printer that takes up over a 1/3 of my desktop, but there you go... rant over (except that I want my money back)... now the rant is over.",2 months ago

Print quality has never been fantastic, but at this point the print quality has degraded to the point documents are unreadable and unusable - despite fresh cartridges, several attempts to align and clean the print heads and even un-installing and re-installing the printer.

Also I want to point out that connecting to a computer wireless is so complicated I regret not spending the extra 80 dollars on the faster printer and with heads up display for easier connection.

120,121,6454282,KansasMeddlingMom,4,Simple But Good,"The HP - DeskJet 2755 Wireless All-In-One Instant Ink-Ready Inkjet printer in white is a very simple machine and affordable printer that has some very good features. Actually, when I saw it I immediately thought how easy it would be to transport this machine from room to room in one's home or take it on vacation if one was using an RV or take it on the road if one travelled to visit their customers and need to be able to print. This printer is very light in weight and has a small footprint when placed on a solid surface, measuring about 17"" looking down from east to west, 12"" from north to south, and 6"" tall. 

This does not come with a full blown owner's manual, to get more information one must go online to www.hp.com/go/DJ2755a . It does come with a ""Get Started"" half-page piece of paper, with pictures, that 1st, asks you to take off the blue tape holding parts in place for shipping and then plug it into the electric socket while turning it on, 2nd to download the HP Smart App which is essential for printer setup, and 3rd follow the app's instructions for set up. I already had the app for a previous set HP printer set up, but they do request that you have the most updated version of that app, by the way. By the way, set up was easy peasy and I do love that it resets its Wi-Fi when I moved it from one location to another, there is a dual bank Wi-Fi with reset and if that is not your condition this printer also has Wi-Fi direct where you can connect either your computer, your smartphone, or your tablet directly to the printer wirelessly. 

So, I have now set this printer up with my Android Smartphone, my HP tablet/laptop, and my desktop, all using different operating systems from the android nougat to Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10. This is a print, scan, and copy printer and you can direct it to print and copy in either color or in black and white on the top of the machine or by the app. 

I am a self-employed CPA and this is not the machine for an office setting where heavy use will occur and the need for speed in printing is vital. However, for so many people that literally live off their phones and get documents with no way to print them this is perfect. I will email clients things to read and/or sign and they have no way to print. Now with the cost of this machine and its ability to print and scan, there is no excurse anymore. While it is not a quick printing experience, it is dependable. Remember that HP has an ink buying program that you must set up within 7 days of setting up for operation starting at free for 15 pages with pricing escalating for more printing that is done. That is the only problem with printers these days, the cost of the ink gets to be more costly than the printer. 

Overall, for the money, ease of set u",1 year ago

122,123,6454282,Sparkles,5,My review of the hp 2700 series printer,"I have really enjoyed owing this printer, easy to use. Very convenient and its functionality is great.",1 month ago
123,124,6454282,CKent,2,I needed a wire to setup wireless,"Low budget price, but it has issues with basic features. Wireless being especially disheartening, considering also that straight out of the box, its your only option. You won't find any USB cables with this printer, just the printer itself, ink cartridges, a power cord and some very basic literature.

Initial setup was actually quite easy. I already had the HP Smart app on my MacBook as I own another HP printer, but this time I decided to give it a try with the Android app version instead.

I turned on WiFi and Bluetooth, selected to add a new printer and the app found the printer right away. After a quick press of the 'info' button on the printer to confirm it's the right one, it proceeded to ask for my network info and finished the setup process. It also detects if you have the HP Print Service Plugin to allow you to print from your phone and will let you install it in the middle of the process making it even easier. The whole thing took just a few minutes and I was ready to go....

....or so I thought. First it asked me if I wanted to share a link to add this printer to other devices, I skipped over that as I didn't think I needed it, a mistake on my part, but we'll come back around to this in a minute.

I then selected 'Print Photos' in the app, selected a pic on my phone to print, and then it started looking for the printer...and looking...and looking until an error popped up ""Unable to communicate with the printer"". Odd considering the phone was literally just communicating with the printer during setup. I hadn't even exited the app or turned anything off at this point.

I kept trying to connect but no dice. The Wifi showed to be connected on the printer itself, and I even checked my network and could see the printer as active with a good connection, yet the app on my phone couldn't find it. I tried powering the printer on and off, turning the wifi on and off, doing the same on my phone, and nothing worked.

I then decided to try and print something from my MacBook, which works fine with my other HP printer. I find something to print, and see the printer in the list of available printers to choose from, select it and error. At this point I figure maybe it needs to be setup on my MacBook as well and proceed to open up the HP Smart app, and even though my laptop can see the printer, the HP Smart app can't. I try to go through the 'Add a new printer' process. The app tries to find it but can't, and since this printer isn't of the touchscreen variety, it tells you to... ATTACH A USB CABLE TO CONTINUE SETUP! A cable that this ""wireless"" printer doesn't come with.

This is where I believe that link I mentioned earlier during setup would be useful. But I skipped over it, and after looking all throughout the app on my phone which did have this printer installed, I couldn't find that link. I guess I should have gotten the link and saved it somewhere when it popped up, but how was I to know?

Luckily I happen to have the proper cable, and with a cable attached, I could print without any issues. I didn't even need to go through the HP Smart app. I just plugged it into my laptop, found something to print, the laptop setup the printer really quick and voila, I had my document.

Once you get it to print, it does the job just fine. Print quality isn't the greatest, but it's a budget printer, and the quality is more than acceptable if all you're doing is printing basic documents.

With the cable attached, I tried to go through the setup process again but on my laptop this time. I had to re-enter my network info and it re-setup the printer, even though it was already connected on my network!? Finally I was able to print to it wirelessly, but only from my laptop, I still, after many hours worth of trying, can't print from my Android phone even though that's what did the initial setup.

This printer is an all-in-one though and can do more than just print. It also scans and copies. The copy function is ok, but text on the copied printout comes out darker than the original, and some lighter colors it has trouble picking up. I made a copy of the 'get started' sheet that comes with the printer and some of the lightly shaded parts of the images didn't come out at all or came out grainy. And while the blacks came out darker on the copied printout, the colors it did get came out lighter.

The buttons on the panel aren't very responsive either. The first time I pressed the copy button nothing happened. I had to press it a second time before it started, and even then you have to give it a little time, definitely not 'instant' as it says in the title.

There's also a tiny lcd screen that displays some basic info. But, it's not backlit, and when you look at it from an angle, you see more than what's actually there. For example, sitting in front of it, I can clearly see an 'E' in the top corner (which I assume stands for Error? I'm not sure), but if you view it from directly above, you clearly see its NOT there.

This printer is also very lightweight, so lightweight though that you have no doubt this is a budget build. It doesn't feel like it could hold up to very much abuse.

To sum it up, I rarely give out low ratings, and try to adjust my expectations accordingly, but I can't in good faith recommend this printer, even with its low cost. It has some serious issues with the wireless functionality and if I didn't happen to have the right usb cable to get it working, this would be a proverbial paperweight.",1 year ago
124,125,6454282,bradrobster,4,Great Budget Printer,"I needed a high quality but lower cost printer for quick things around the house. I still have another non-HP Laser that is a bit big by today’s standard but with both my wife and I working out of the house now, I especially wanted something I could print off some stuff for work. I also was interested in the Scan/copy functions that I also use frequently. This printer really hit the mark on all those areas and a few other features I will mention.

Unboxing and setup were super simple. I downloaded the HP Smart App on my iPad first. Plugged in the printer, put the 2 cartridges in (very simple with diagram to make it fool proof) and turned it on. There are two cartridges, one for Black and one for Color. The app found the printer, recognized my Wi-Fi and brought up the password screen and within about a minute, it was setup and ready to go. First, I printed a couple pics from the iPad with it. Quality was good, not great but again, this is budget printer and probably not one you would use for high quality pics. All the text docs that I printed looked amazing! I did not sign up for the instant ink yet. I am still looking at the cost effectiveness of it.

As for the HP Smart App, I like it! I literally put it on my iPad, my Android Phone and my windows PC. Each one found the printer now that it was already on my network and setup was seamless and less than a minute for each, really only about 20 seconds max! The app worked great on all three platforms. I really like being able to have a common interface across the platforms with consistent results. I like the flexibility of using the phone for Camera Scan and printer scan. Another neat feature is the Smart Tasks. This allows you to combine tasks, such as Camera Scan to Email or another good one if you travel, Scan receipts to multiple Destinations. This allows you to structure tasks into fewer steps. 

Overall this printer is above average for the cost. Considering the price point of $69.99, it’s very reasonable considering the 4800x1200 Color resolution and 1200x1200 for Black and about a 15 second first page out printing, it’s hard to complain for $70 bucks. 

Time will tell if it holds up but for now, I would recommend this. I have tried successfully all the features important to me from pc, iPad and android phone. I am happy.",1 year ago

129,130,6454282,Wishkid,5,Excellent simple to use printer,"After unboxing I was happy to find a device that would not take up too much space on my desk. It is the perfect size and allows me to complete just the tasks I need from home; it brought a simple power cord with two small ink cartridges and some paperwork. I enjoy the paper feed from above as it further reduces the amount of space it takes up. The set up was super easy and user friendly, all I had to do was download the HP Smart app and follow the prompts from there. I would say it took me about 10 minutes to connect to my home wifi and my multiple devices. Once set up I was able to send a link to other devices so they could connect to the printer as well, it was very convenient. It comes with a 2 month inclusion of instant ink, a set up in which the printer will automatically order ink for you when it's time and it's delivered to my home. 

Apart from its sleek look it’s speed was perfect, I was able to print my twenty page document within minutes, the color was vivid and the photos clear and discernable. I love that you have the ability to print/scan not just from anywhere in your home but, you can also print from anywhere you have an internet connection using the print anywhere feature . I think anyone would be able to set this printer up with no issues whatsoever. There are 6 buttons on the top of the printer with a small LCD screen that display the printer information and ink levels. Overall this is a very nice looking and simple to use printer. Definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a space saver and quick printing/copying/scanning device.",3 months ago

The printer/scanner operation is very quiet - especially the scanner - which is nice but I've opened the cover more than once and it's still scanning. The print quality is decent - text is clear and photos are good quality. The printer does require the HP Smart app, which is fairly straight forward if you are familiar with your networks You can print either by being connected to the same network as the printer, or by sending the file to an email address for the printer.

Once I got the printer setup thru my computer, I was able to use the HP smart app for my phone. You need to download the HP smart app on the computer to set it up or the computer won’t detect it (at least my Dell didn’t). The printer has dual band WiFi which allows it to operate on the generally less crowded 5 ghz spectrum. The biggest thing with ink jet printers or printers in general has always been the ink price, the price with this one doesn’t seem that bad. HP says their instant ink subscription can save you up to 50% also if you go that route. The printer offers an overall good value, with an app that needs an update (as of this review) to fix the WiFi issue.",2 months ago

I would suggest using the computer to update the printer before trying to connect the web services. I Did a search on YouTube and found out how to update which worked for me. The printer itself seems really nice, I’ve already printed several pages and they’ve all come out really nice. I think if this printer came with better instructions and a guide on how to update your Printer before starting the set up it would get much better reviews and be much easier deal with. I would recommend this printer if you are somewhat technically inclined. The only reason this did not get five stars for me is because I feel like the set up system is a little bit difficult and it needs to be more user-friendly especially for people that Don’t know much about computers.",1 year ago

153,154,6470010,JimC,5,"Elegant, Fast & Goodbye to Expensive Ink Cartridge","This printer is a superb choice if quality and cost per page is important to you. The Epson ET-3850 wireless EcoTank All-in-One Printer is a very reliable, inexpensive, easy to use and compact device which will economically and quietly print large quantities of documents at a very nice quality level. 

Epson is one of the three major units of Japan’s Seiko Group (the other two produce Seiko watches and SII microelectronics.) Seiko created the printing timers used in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, then developed the first electronic mini-printer (the EP-101) in 1968. In 1975 the company created the Epson name to brand the next generation of printers based upon the EP-101 technology. Epson literally means “son of EP” and it introduced dot matrix printers in 1978. Epson created the micro piezo inkjet technology (which is the basis for most modern inkjet printers) in 1993. To combat the cost and waste associated with inkjet cartridges Epson released the first of the EcoTank line of printers in 2015. When it comes to printer technology you can’t go wrong with Epson!

First impression of this printer is that is elegantly styled in an arctic white with subtly rounded corners to relieve the bulkiness seen in some competitors’ devices. It has a minimal impact upon your workspace with a nearly square footprint (just 14.8” x 13.7”) and stands a compact 9.1” tall. Epson cleverly designed the sheet feeder to fold flat when not in use, minimizing both the height and the width of the printer. The power cord has no bulky transformer on it so it adds to the clean look of the printer. Overall you will be pleased to share your office with this beautiful unit, especially since when in operation it is very quiet. Wirelessly connected, it can be located in any convenient space – it does not need to be next to the PC it is serving. This is ideal for homes and small offices since you can also use this great device as a supplemental copier.

Setting up this printer is very easy. Epson protects the printer during shipping with tape around key parts, but all of the tape is bright blue and very easy to remove. The quick setup instructions are well-written (unlike those of some other manufacturers) and you could just read them. But an even easier method is to download the Epson Smart Panel to your phone. Attach the power cord to the printer, but don’t turn it on. Then just obey the illustrated step-by-step instructions in the app. Filling the ink tanks on the printer Is foolproof. The ink bottles have alignment tabs which securely hold the bottle while it fills the respective printer tank and the filling process stops automatically when the tank is full. There will be some ink left in the bottle, so reclose it and store it in a seal bag (see photo) to prevent possible leakage. Flip down the ink tank cap and repeat the process with each ink color.

Once the ink tanks have been filled, turn on the printer’s power and follow the detailed instructions in the Epson Smart Panel. The system will be charged with ink in a process that takes about ten minutes. The control panel will display the progress during this step.

Next, load some paper and the printer will conduct an alignment process during which four pages will be printed and you will be asked a series of question to select the line on the page which best matches the sample shown on the control panel. 

Once the alignment is complete you can continue to follow the Epson Smart Panel app to connect the printer to your wireless network. Alternatively, you could use the CD included with the printer to establish the wireless connection. The CD also contains the supplemental software which you will use to get maximum benefit from the printer.

If, for some reason you do not want to use the printer’s wireless connection option, there are two other connection methods: attaching an Ethernet cable to your router or using a USB cable to your PC.

Any computer on your network should be able to access the printer. If you don’t want to use the setup CD and have a Windows PC just go to Settings, then Devices and select Add Printer. The Epson printer should be discovered and the driver automatically downloaded.

The Epson ET-3850 has a large (250 sheet) paper capacity in the lower paper drawer. It loads easily and is adjustable for multiple paper sizes. To print envelopes you must remove the paper and adjust the paper guides to the width of the envelope. If you want to use legal-size paper the end of the paper tray flips down to accommodate the longer paper.

Print quality is really excellent, even in the economy (standard) mode. In the higher quality (business document) mode the print quality matches most laser printers I have used. The printer driver provides nice printing options like 2 on 1, 4 on 1 and up to 16 on 1 (number of page images on a single sheet of paper), borderless, scaled, fit-to-page, booklet and others. The most useful option is the automatic duplexing (two-sided printing) which it manages without drama.

Photo printing quality is quite good and will satisfy most purposes. (If you want really outstanding photo printing quality you should invest in a dedicated photo printer with more than three ink colors.) This printer’s color capability will be best used in printing business documents (graphs, multi-colored text, PowerPoint slide copies, etc.) and it does a very nice job on such tasks. The printing speed is not equal to that of a laser printer but certainly acceptable at about 16 pages/minute (black) and about 8 pages/minute for color documents (speeds estimated by my own testing.) For home use and most small offices this is more than adequate.

Scanning, at resolutions up to 1200 x 2400 dpi, can be managed from the printer’s control panel or by using the included Espson Smart Scan Utility (or by just using Windows Fax and Scan utility.) I recommend Epson’s utility which will scan to a PDF, stich large documents together and facilitate OCR, among other features. 

The copy function is excellent, producing up to 99 copies in black print or color from each original with options for shrinking or enlarging originals, adjusting contrast, etc. The color control panel walks you through the options available or you can just hit the start button to make a single copy with the default settings and the automatic document feeder.

Other bonus features include easy printing from phones and tablets using the free Epson app.

But the most important feature of the Epson ET-3850 All-in-One Inkjet Printer/Copier/Scanner is that wonderful EcoTank. It holds 127 ml of black ink and a total of 210 ml of color ink (70 ml each of cyan, yellow and magenta). Those massive tanks will print about 7,500 sheets of black ink documents and about 6,000 sheets of color documents. If you print ten pages a day that initial ink supply will last you for more than three years! The best part is the incredibly low cost of the ink. The refills for the ink tanks are far less expensive than replacement cartridges. The cost comparison to standard ink cartridges is amazing. A typical replacement inkjet cartridge for other printers costs $30 to $40 and will print 220-350 pages at an ink cost per page of about $0.09. The ink cost per page of the EcoTank system is about $0.004 – less than 5% of the cost of a standard inkjet printer! If you are upgrading from a traditional inkjet printer you may be used to minimizing your printing to avoid the expense of ink cartridge replacement. This Epson Et-3850 will free you to print much more readily since you have a cost per page lower than almost any other printing device on the market.

Those savings are due to the fact that you are not replacing the print head, as you must with each new ink cartridge, and the elimination of the plastic cartridge body cost. The ecological benefits of eliminating this waste are a nice bonus. The only replacement item on the Epson ET-3850 is a “maintenance box” which collects excess ink. It costs about $15 and probably needs replacement every other year. 

The only caution that I would advise is that you print at least one page in black ink and one color copy every month to keep the ink lines from potentially drying out from lack of use. 

The more I use the Epson ET-3850 EcoTank All-in-One Inkjet Printer/Copier/Scanner, the more I like it. I can happily give this great printer a full five stars and my unqualified endorsement. Buy it without qualms!",2 months ago
154,155,6470010,ITJim,3,"Great printing and Flatbed, Poor ADF and Reds","Disclaimer:

I am a member of Best Buy’s Technical Insider Network, TIN for short. Reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews.

First Impression:

The Epson ET-3850 is lite weight when compared with other multi-function printers I have owned. Single page text and duplex page text print quickly and print to first page is as fast as any laser printer I have used. I was very surprised by how quickly full-page graphics print. Flatbed scanning is quick and detailed. However, colors are not accurate enough for my tastes. I found color accuracy issues with both scanning images and printing images. Scanning documents via the page feeder is terrible. Loading ink is super easy and mess free. The ink tanks hold enough ink to last a good long while under moderate use. See below for further details.

Setup:

It took me 20 to 30 minutes to setup this printer. Unboxing was easy but time consuming. There was a lot of protective tape used to prevent the printer’s moving parts, doors, and sliders from being damaged in transit. The printer includes four bottles of ink (Magenta, Blue, Yellow, Black), an installation CD, quick start guide, and the usual warranty information. See included photo. 

You can setup the printer in a few ways: install the included software suite, configure from the printers control panel, or use the Epson app on your cell phone. I chose to configure the printer using the app on my phone. The app walked me through setting up the printer, filling the ink wells, priming the printer, setting up the network, and more. The app setup process is interactive and resembles a texting conversation. I included an image of one of the setup steps. 

Loading the ink from the bottles was quick, painless, and clean. To see how clean, I laid a scrap piece of pure white towel on the table in front of the ink wells. Each color is loaded one at a time. The neck of the bottle fits snuggling into the tank head and forces the bottle’s seal to open. The tank is gravity fed and will auto stop filling when the tank is full. On bottle dripped a few drops of ink as I removed the bottle from the tank head. I removed this bottle too slow and tilted it to one side as I removed it. Otherwise, there was zero mess. The attached photo is the white after all tanks were filled.

The Ink priming process takes about 10 minutes. The print head alignment process takes about another ten minutes. I did not like the alignment process. It was four printed pages of being asked to tell the difference between six possible line configurations and picking out the best. The alignment images were so small that I had to inspect each printed page under a magnifying glass just to see them. Then, I spent a good minute or two trying to figure out which of the six picks were most correct. I think Epson could have accomplish the results with larger alignment images. Anyone without perfect 20/20 vision will have a very difficult time with this.

Finally, if you do not have a CD player then you can go to Epson.com/support and get all the software that ships with the printer including the printer drivers.

Printing:

Fantastic speed and clarity. Single page black and white zoom out of the printer. All ink jet printers I have owned print one line of text at a time. The ET-3850 seems to print a quarter of the page at a time. I cannot confirm if this is happening, but I stand by my statement that this a fast printer. I would say as fast as a fully warmed up and ready to print laser printer. Duplex printing is a little slow mostly because the printer must pull the page back into the printer and flip it over. The duplex mechanism is still close to what I have experience with a laser printer.

Color accuracy, however, needs improvement. My biggest gripe is Red. Reds come out orange and never match the original source material. For a test, I downloaded a simple color wheel. See attached images. I printed the color wheel using high resolution settings. The Red and Orange look almost the same. I scanned the image back into the system using both the Automatic document feeder (ADF) and the flatbed scanner. Each scanner read the image differently. Both samples are included in the attached photo. Finally, I photographed the printed color wheel with my Sony Alpha camera in full daylight. I realize the white balance in the photo is off but the differences between orange and red are still evident. 

As a second test, I scanned in a book cover that had a very vibrant red to it. I then printed that scan and got a very weak red color like the color wheel. I did not include an image of this test because it did not prove anything different than what my color wheel images already reveal.

The next test was the difference between the ADF and the flatbed scanner. The ADF has color accuracy issues, paper jamming issues, and does an over-all crummy job creating an accurate scan. See attached photo. For this test, I used the book cover I mentioned in the last paragraph. You can see that the flatbed scan is crisp, clean, and vibrant. The document feeder is a printed copy of the book cover from the flatbed scanner. You can see the colors are dull, washed out, and the image is full of horizontal white lines and artifacts. The artifacts are more clearly present in the pure text example I included in the same image. I would compare the image quality of the ADF to that of a fax machine. The text I scanned is from a report that I printed from the ET-3850. The original hard copy looked crisp and without any artifacts. I did notice that the AFP did not smoothly pull the document through the paper feed and through the scanner. I think this led to both the poor scan quality as well as some of the paper jams I encountered.

Faxing:

The ET-3850 has zero faxing capabilities.

Interface Panel:

The interface panel is easy to use, quick between the menus, and well laid out. The display is not touch a screen. Everything is driven by a touch pad. The interface panel is on a hinge that allows that screen to be parallel with the floor for easy use. Then it can folded out of the way when not in use. The LCD panel does have a time-out and will eventually turn off. The power button light will not turn off under any power condition other than unplugged. The power button light is bright enough to light up a small room. If you find this annoying, then you will need to put a piece of tape over the power button. I was unable to find a setting that turned off or dimmed the power light.

Images:

Full page color prints on standard quality are almost as fast as a full page of black and white text. Fine detail prints take about three times longer. To be honest, I did not see much of a difference between standard quality and high quality. I did not see a setting to allow the printer to do borderless prints. It will print full page with an eighth of an inch white boarder around the image. The printed images are clean, lines are sharp, but color saturation can be muddy at times. For example, I printed the one and only image that I can find on the internet of the Battlestar Galactica from Blood and Chrome. On the screen, I could make out all the detail between the Galactica and the space station in the background. Detail was lost in center of the image where the high contrast features were overtaken the darker colors. The detail that did show was much darker than in the original image. 

I also saw a similar affect with the image of the Enterprise B from the book cover of Star Trak Shipyards from Eaglemoss. The starship has a lot of dark blues. This caused parts of the ship to fully vanish against the darker background when I printed the image I made from the ET-3850’s flatbed scanner. Is this good enough for term papers and business reports? Yes. Is it good enough to print high quality printers for display in your office? No. 

Finally, Reds are not accurate.

Final thoughts:

This printer may not be for you if you require the use of all the features this printer provides. The ADF mechanism is not the best I have used. Color accuracy, paper jams, and scan quality are all major issues for the ADF. Print quality is excellent if you don’t require color accurate reds. I also find detail lost in scenes where a lot of like colors saturate the image. 

This may be the printer for you if your main goals are lighting fast prints great flatbed scanning capabilities. Epson does market this printer as a home printer and not a home office printer. If you do not need the ADF or faxing functions then this is a good printer for work from home school, or collage. 

One thing that I really love about this printer is the ADF tray folds up into a flat surface. This may sound minor but ADFs waste space. This allows safe storage of laptops, papers, books, whatever you have. 

Taken as a whole, the ET-3850 needs some work before I could recommend. If you need a solid MFP that is fast, holds a lot of ink, and can produce great looking reports then this is an easy printer to recommend. 

I hope you found this review helpful. Thank you.",2 months ago
155,156,6470010,RedScorpion,5,Great Printer for the Home Office,"The Epson EcoTank ET-3850 printer has ink for years. That's not hyperbole, it really does have ink for years. And, when that ink runs out, you could replace the black and color cartridges for around $60 on BestBuy.com. If you can get past the initial expense, the EcoTank ET-3850 is an economical printer that does a good job with daily prints, photo prints, and scanning. For those reasons, I recommend the ET-3850.

Setup:
Epson includes a compact disc with drivers and software, but as my PCs no longer have disc drives, I had to download PC software from epson.com/support. Look for drivers and software for the ET-3850. 
After installation, the software found additional updates on check. 

But, if you choose to go the mobile route, the Epson Smart Panel software was easy to use and provides a simple interface to set up, print, scan, or troubleshoot the printer. Smart Panel was an easy and convenient way to print documents or queue photo prints directly from my phone.

The printer can connect via WiFi on the 2.4ghz band (wifi-direct or over a router), LAN, or USB. There is no included USB or Lan cable. I chose to hook the printer up via WiFi. As long as I was connecting straight to the router, the setup was easy. If I tried to hook up to a WiFi extender, the printer had trouble connecting and communicating with my devices. Not sure if that was a problem with my extender or the printer, but, if you can, your best bet is to hook up to your primary router.

Installing the 502 ink was easy and I didn't have any mess. There's a locking system in place to keep the ink from spilling before the tube docks with the printer. But I'm not sure what would keep someone from putting the wrong ink into the wrong slot. I couldn't tell if the colors and black were uniquely keyed. Maybe they are, but I wasn't about to test and find out. Long story short, make sure you match up the colors to the right dock.

Also, I should point out that in addition to the ink, the printer requires a maintenance box, part number T04D100, which wears out over time. Price for the maintenance box varied, but it seems to run between $15 and $25 depending on retailer. 

Experience: 

The printer is fast with regular prints. Dual sided printing worked, but did experience more of a delay. I printed photos on Epson Premium 4X6 and 5X7 photo paper. I thought the prints came out great. I love the color from Epson printers and the ET-3850 was great in that regard. Blues and purples really popped and lines looked crisp and sharp

Cons: 

Not enough to ding the review, but there are a few design decisions that I wish where changed or improved upon. First, there is no USB or SD Card input. As a result, you won't be able to print directly from a USB stick.

There's only one paper tray (or paper cassette). If I want to switch from printing standard documents to printing envelopes or photos, I have to take out the existing paper and make adjustments to the tray and the software on the printer. 

The auto document feeder was a bit of a struggle. Thinner paper wasn't picked up as easily and I found myself working to get some documents through. But on the whole scanning worked well and looked good.

Conclusion:

All of that aside, I like the printer. It's nice seeing the physical ink levels from the front of the device. I like how the photos look. Document prints have been done well and single sided prints have come out fast. All-in-all, the ET-3850 is a solid printer for any home office.",2 months ago
156,157,6470010,Jacbo14,5,EcoTank Supertank is a Game Changer,"SUMMARY

Printers have always been troublesome pieces of tech for me, which is usually down to just a few recurring things: 

1. Getting the printer to stay connected wirelessly to the print devices
2. Troubleshooting errors when they occur
3. Having to constantly buy ink cartridge bundles to replace colors which never last

So far, this EcoTank printer has tackled each of my three biggest issues with clever solutions that finally make a home office printer which is both a great performer and supremely easy to use. Between no issues connecting to all of my printing sources, a very helpful companion app that makes understanding the printer easy, and the EcoTank system which uses ink reservoirs instead of cartridges, there is a lot to love with this printer. Yes, it does have a higher upfront price tag, and is not going to win any speed printing competitions, but when you consider the amount of ease you get, not to mention the low running/operating costs, the price tag becomes a lot more reasonable.

SET-UP PROCESS

From the get-go the EcoTank ET-3850 makes a great impression, and that is down to the set-up process. I would highly recommend anyone getting this printer to download the Epson Smart Panel app, which features a virtual assistant like set-up process where the app talks you through setting-up the printer step-by-step, which is admittedly quite quick as easy. Most of the set-up involves removing all of the packaging material on the printer, loading the ink via the included bottles (which stop filling automatically once the reservoirs are full), connecting to your Wi-Fi (which can be done via the app while the ink initialization is getting ready), and running an optional but recommended print calibration process to dial everything in. Once that is all done, its simply a matter of connecting to the printer from your print source and then you are off to the races. Paper can be loaded via a standard tray on the bottom of the printer which pulls out, and you can pull out a separate tray right above it to catch paper as they print. 

OPERATION

The best place to start here is with the headlining feature, the EcoTank/Supertank which uses ink reservoirs instead of cartridges. What this means is that not only do you use much less plastic without needing to constantly replace plastic cartridges, but you also get a lot more ink for your buck, with a quoted 2 years’ worth of ink in the box, assuming normal printing loads. We print quite a lot at our house, certainly above average given our jobs requiring physical materials & documents, and thus far we have barely seen the ink levels move in the EcoTank reservoirs. Speaking of which, being able to physically see the reservoirs empty with the semi-transparent windows on the front is a small but amazing feature. It was always annoying dealing with surprising warning messages that you were almost out of ink when using cartridge-based systems, but now you can actually see where you ink levels are at in real time, and use that to help prepare for what colors you might need. Likewise, you don’t have to deal with annoying multi-color cartridges, so if a particular color is running out quicker than the others, you can just refill that color. Likewise, if you don’t use a whole bottle of ink, you can simply reseal the bottle and save it for later, so no ink is wasted.

In terms of operation when it comes to user interface, this is largely good, but not the best I have used. You use buttons to navigate the admittedly small screen, which does feel a bit of a step back compared to modern touchscreen displays. I’d prefer to have a slightly larger touchscreen with smaller buttons, but in terms of overall usage, this isn’t a deal-breaker by any means. The actual UI itself is fine as well, with easy navigation to the various menus and sub-menus, and clear locations for everything within the software.

Now for the big one: printing. First, to start with the good, print quality is great. Text is sharp and colors look great. You can print from your computer or your phone, and you are able to print with smart assistants for voice-activated printing. Where printing faulters a bit is with speed, which I would classify as “good but not great”. You are not going to be left waiting all day for things to print, but if you are a super printer who needs high volume documents quickly, you might want to invest in a model or two higher than this. The printer does possess what Epson calls PrecisionCore Heat-Free technology, which leaves pages cool even after lots of printing, and doesn’t result in any distorted text or graphics. Likewise, you do get automatic two-sided printing as well, which is one of my must-have features with any printer.

Now I know I have focused a lot on printing, but this is actually more than a printer, as the ET-3850 also has a scanner & copier as well, which likewise perform very well across the board. Finally, one last positive I want to mention is the size of the printer. As this printer is designed for mostly home office functionality, you want it to be as compact as possible. The ET-3850 on that note is surprisingly compact, with more height than width, which is how I prefer my printer to be, given desk space is a valuable resource in my relatively small home office. 

CONCLUSION

Honestly, if you couldn’t tell already, I really like this printer. It has all of the essentials I need in a home office printer, and then builds upon this with a very large ink tank system, great print quality, a very easy set-up system, strong companion app, and compact form factor. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, it does possess a significant upfront cost, but for all of the cost you save in maintenance and the great ease of set-up/troubleshooting, it doesn’t feel like a bad value at all. Highly recommended.",3 months ago
157,158,6470010,RogueWave,5,Epson Nailed It!,"I am so happy that I stumbled upon this printer!! This new Epson EcoTank ET- 3850 is perfect for the at-home office, or for an at-home printer. The setup was super easy, and the printer allows you to print in many ways. I love that this printer comes with its own email address when you register it, and you can simply email the printer and it will print pictures or documents. I also love the app that you can download on either iOS or Android, it also makes printing super easy. I have never had a printer that can do double-sided printing before, but once you have one that can do automatic double-sided printing, you realize quickly what you were missing. I had to print out some forms for my child’s daycare and this printer didn’t skip a beat when printing on both sides, it's incredible. As I said previously, setting up the printer was easy and with the initialization test prints, they were spot on right out of the box. The tray holds 250 pages of paper, and the tray aligns the paper perfectly. The screen is 2.4 inches and is color, I really like how you can adjust the screen and buttons by pulling them out and up, that way the screen is facing you while looking down at it, but also can be put back vertically. This printer can literally do it all whether it be print, scan, or copy, and can be used from a mobile device, computer, email, Wi-Fi, or through the app. The most impressive component to this printer would have to be everything about the ink. Let’s talk about the ink!! This printer comes with 2 years’ worth of ink in the box! I still can’t get over how this printer takes and stores the ink. Epson knocked it out of the park with this idea. To fill the printer with ink, it's as simple as unscrewing the cap, and setting the bottle to its respected color, and watching the ink bubble down into the reservoir. There is enough ink to print roughly 12,000 pages! I am so happy to never have to buy another messy, fragile, and expensive cartridge again. This printer is the boss of at-home printers, an absolute powerhouse, and not one time has it given me any grief. Never once had the printer not connected and printed flawlessly. I am extremely pleased with this printer and can strongly recommend it to anyone with a home office, anyone who wants to print photos or documents while at home or away, or anyone who has kids with lots of school projects, you won’t be disappointed.",2 months ago

So after about a Month of research I decided to go with the Epson Eco Thank ET-3850. Set up was a breeze with the App. My family really love this printer. For now Its working great. I read a comment about how this printer make a lot of noise when printing. That is true straight out of the box, but you can fix that problem by going through the setting on the printer not the App. There is a setting that you can turn on to make the printer print quiet.",1 month ago
159,160,6470010,RalphHenry,5,Capable Printer with Ink Tanks,"It is very easy to install this printer using the Epson Smart Panel cell phone app. The ability to print from your cell phone is very handy. Next, you go to your PC and install the utilities from the provided DVD disk. You will have the abilities to print and scan from your PC or initiate a scan/copy from the printer control panel. After you have connected the WiFi setup, it is a good idea to check and install the newest firmware, and there is a simple interface to do this.
The installation, though simple, does take about 15 minutes from start to finish. You will install the ink, initialize the ink supply, align the print heads and set up your wireless connection. Don’t rush if it is your first try with the Eco Tank cartridges and don’t touch the exposed top of the supply bottles. Epson very smartly made it so that each color has a different ‘plug’ end such that you cannot put the wrong color ink into the reservoirs. Also the printer senses when the ink reservoir is filled and stops the input of ink – that was kind of magical – well done by Epson. 
I tested the printing, copying and scanning for black/white and color printing and was very pleased with the clarity and colors. Of course a big plus is the EcoTank system. The printer includes a larger bottle of ink for each color. I can’t test the claim of 2 years of ink yet, but I certainly observed the ink supplied was at least 5 times what you see in ‘normal’ ink cartridges. Note after the ink is initialized, the reservoirs have lowered because the ink is put into the connecting pipes etc., so don’t be concerned. If you had some ink left in each bottle (which I did have), you can add it at this point. Note to add ink you should use the add ink menu since it will ask you to ‘proceed’ when done so that the ink levels will be recalibrated by the printer. 
I’m very pleased with this printer from all functional angles and I am very happy about the EcoTank system which will reduce the time spent for buying/replacing cartridges and will reduce cost of printing for me. I do highly recommend this nice printer.",3 months ago

161,162,6470010,PeboQuattro,4,Good choice for home office,"The Epson EcoTank ET-3850 is a nice all in one printer that provides the basic functionality (copy, print, & scan) you are looking for in a printer, but at a better value compared to most cartridge based printers. The main draw to Epson’s EcoTank line of printers is the “cartridge free” feature that not only offers convenience but cost savings over the typical ink cartridge systems we are all too familiar with. Instead of wasteful, expensive cartridges that only last a few hundred pages; Epson designed a unique tank system that is easy to fill and reasonably priced. Each bottle offers up to 7,500 pages for black and 6,000 pages for color far exceeding typical ink cartridges, which means less waste too! The included set of ink bottles completely fill the printer, which is nice knowing I won’t be hunting down refills anytime soon. 

The design is basic but clean in an all white finish. The ET-3850 ink wells are in the front, providing a nice visible ink level indicator. Navigation is performed with an adjustable control panel and is easy to use. Basic printing and copying works as expected, this model includes a 30-sheet ADF which aids dramatically in scanning or copying multiple pages. The cassette holds half a ream, which is plenty for a home office printer. At about 15ppm black and 8ppm color, it could be faster but for most people who just print periodically this won’t be an issue.
 
The printer does what I need flawlessly, being able to periodically AirPrint a photo or document without worrying about the printer having enough ink is a winner. If you are looking for a no frills printer that won’t burn your wallet with ink refills, the Epson ET-3850 is a great value and highly recommended.",2 months ago

163,164,6470010,clow18,5,Incredible Printer All-Around,"Let me start off by saying this printer had the easiest, most satisfying setup process I’ve gone through. In this day and age, it is rare that the setup instructions received match up exactly with real world practice. Epson knocked it out of the park with these instructions. I know that may sound trivial, but it is so refreshing to read instructions that match up word for word with what you are trying to accomplish.

The setup itself will take roughly 30 minutes, but the majority is waiting for the printer to set itself up, which is fine. The printer comes with 4 bottles of ink, each of which you will load into the printer itself when told do so by the EpsonSmartPanel app (which is incredibly easy to use). I had ZERO issues putting ink into the printer and the mechanism in which you load the ink is simple, yet effective (and oddly satisfying!). I spilled no ink and had no messy toner to deal with.

The aforementioned EpsonSmartPanel app will walk you through step-by-step on how to setup the printer (wifi, ink, head calibration, etc.). I have no complaints at all on the EpsonSmartPanel app.

Lastly, make sure you download the PC software needed for the printer, which can be found at https://epson.com/Support or if you still have a CD drive in your PC, they include a disk for install as well. I for one try and utilize drivers made specifically for the devices I use (I find you tend to have less issues in the long run).
Overall, I could not be happier with this printer. The pages I have printed have been quick, clean, and easily visible. There are no random marks on pages where ink has leaked onto the page. The printer is not overly loud (it does have a silent mode, which will tone down the noise of the printer, if you need) which is a plus.
Well done, Epson.",3 months ago

165,166,6470010,D1maddog1,5,Best Printer I've Ever Used,"I've tried quite a few printers, but Epson has been my 'go-to' brand for years. This may be the best printer I've ever used. 

It connects in the standard way to your Mac / PC. But it's very easy to set it up via WiFi for wireless printing. There is an app (Epson Smart Panel) to download to your phone (iPhone or Android), which sets up the printer, including configuration of your home network. Using the app, you can print from Google Classroom and print photos from your phone, among other functions. 

Once printer setup is done, you add the ink, which the app steps you through. The system is well-designed for filling. The cartridges are well-marked, and the bottles can only be inserted one way (in one orientation). I thought filling would be messy, but the bottles have a valve on them, that only opens when inserted into the ink reservoir. There is no spillage whatsoever. The flip up lids on the ink reservoirs have gaskets that seat tightly, so you don't have to worry about ink drying up. The ink bottles, I expect, will last SO much longer, and they are so much cheaper. The days of printing everything in black and white, due to the price of ink, are definitely over!! VERY exciting!

One of the best things? It's fast. Even double-sided and color prints. I use my printer wirelessly, and when I press 'Enter' to print, the job starts printing immediately, with little to no time lag. Printouts and pictures are crisp. 

This printer truly raises the bar. Again, it's really wonderful that I can print things in color without second-guessing if I need to, due to the price of ink. I have no negatives / 'Cons' about this product; it really is that good.",2 months ago
166,167,6470010,BubbaSparks,3,Won’t scan both sides. Cloud scan setup confusing,Disappointed that this printer does not scan or copy both sides of documents. For $400 this should be a feature that’s included. Going to return. Setup takes awhile. Not intuitive at all to setup to scan to cloud. Many people may never figure it out.,2 weeks ago
167,168,6470010,Rivae,5,Awesome bit of kit,"I'll be honest, about the 15th color book report that needed printed nearly 10 years ago, I realized that a color laser printer was my best bet. I had just tried to deal with refilling some ink cartridges and then came to the horrific conclusion that I'd have to basically pay for my printer again to buy another set of ink which was compounding by the fact that I hadn't even used up the existing, it'd just dried up. Thus started my relationship with color lasers and I've never looked back... until now. Bravo on Epson taking the step to actually make these inks cartridges refillable and even going so far as to provide bottles so you understand right from the start how to fill it up. 

Overall everything came clearly packaged and getting started was a breeze. There's a quick start guide commonly found in all tech products nowadays. Removing the two top foam pieces allows you to lift the printer out and the power cord and bottles of (vacuum sealed) ink are individually packaged so there's no danger of them spilling. When you first startup the printer, there's a QR code displayed on the front of the LCD. Scanning this code gets you to install the Epson app which leads you through setup. After that printing is fairly easy. You can install the app so you can print from a mobile device. Adding the printer on Windows can be done via the standard add printer process on your machine once the printer has been setup with its wireless connection.

Obviously this is an all-in-one so scanning, copying, and printing are all available. Copying using the flat bed glass surface was easy and produced quality copies. The auto-feeder tray is kind of nice up top because you can fold it out of the way to make a smooth surface when it's not in use. Paper is loaded with the print surface down in case you're loading special paper or labels. Print quality is great and definitely on par with the best inkjets I've used in the past.

All in all this is a great hybrid between the longevity of a laser printer and the ease of an inkjet (aka I don't have to have special laser paper for stickers!) I haven't printed enough to refill yet but since I'm familiar from the initial filling, I'm reasonably assured it won't be a problem. Just remember to not squeeze the bottles as once they're set into their respective funnels, they will drain ink into the reservoir until filled!",2 months ago
168,169,6470010,Crasher,4,Decent Printer,"The Epson Ecotank is a great printer that offers an alternative to the standard ink cartridge set up. And while this may seem like a great away to go there are some things to be aware of. 

Out of the box you get everything you need to set up your printer. You are provided both 4 colors of ink which in all reality should last you easily 6 months to a year depending on how much printing you do. Installation of the ink is easy as the ink bottles utilize a one way valve to eliminate accidental spillage. The tanks are also keyed meaning that each color ink bottle will only poor in to its corresponding ink tank. This eliminates the possibility of mixing colors up. Set up is quick fast and easy and should be able to be accomplished automatically depending on your computers operating system. If not there is nothing to fear as Epson also provides a free app that allows all the same functions as your PC. Just like a standard printer, with this set up you can easily print, scan, and email documents. There is also a built in LCD screen on the printer which acts as a HUD allowing you to manually input functions as well as change printer settings and access firmware updates. Set up can be done wired or wirelessly and the printer does allow for Android/IOS printing as well.

Why buy this design over a conventional cartridge style? The overall design is too allow for two functions based on what i can see. First off they aim to create less waste by having to dispose of cartridges about every couple months which in turn will create a smaller carbon footprint. And second they are trying to do away with unnecessary ink charges by providing a tank that in all reality should easily get up to a year or more before needing a refill which in turn will save you a lot more money in the long run. Print quality is not sacrificed what so ever, in fact i personally was impressed with how vibrant the colors were. There was no ink run off and after a freshly printed page the ink is almost completely dry when it comes out. Overall on paper this unit looks like a good buy however i do feel there are a few things a consumer needs to be aware before making this purchase. Before i touch on this i want to let you know that i actually own the previous model to this Ecotank set up and i can personally tell you that after about a year and half of light use i have yet to refill the tanks. Which is a very positive thing to touch on, now with that being said there are some common issues that were ran in to that are only experienced after prolonged use and one that i hope Epson has remedy. On a standard cartridge set up, every time you replace the cartridge your not just replacing the ink but your also getting a new jet. This means that you get a fresh spray and clean lines with every new switch out. On the Epson Ecotank that is not the case here. Since your not replacing cartridges but rather simply refilling the ink tanks this means your using the same ink jets over and over again which will lower print quality. I have found one way to combat this but it requires regular maintenance. Now yes the printer does allow a function to clear the jets out and i cant stress how important it is to do this every month, but even with that said they are still prone to clogging. So much so in fact that you can actually google Epson Ecotank problems and that will come up as the number one most common problem. I have actually experienced this on my previous model where picture quality declined at the 8 month mark and at the 1 year mark my colored jets had clogged completely forcing me to only print in black ink. Removal of the jets for cleaning is not a difficult task but it does require some knowledge and know how and is not a five minute job. I bring this up because this a known problem that not many people know about. I only know this due to the passage of time on my previous printer. Now im not trying to discourage anyone from buying this printer as the print quality and overall marketing of this printer is a good one with good intentions. More importantly Epson may have fixed this issue on their newest flagship with the ET-3850. All im simply saying is this, time is going to be the real test on rather or not this printer can hold up and if Epson has remedy their past problems. Simply do some research and maybe wait a bit to insure all the kinks have been worked out with the jet issues they used to have. If that problem has been fixed then i would say yes, this is a great buy. For me im not sold on it yet until i know all the issues have been worked out or more importantly at least provided a easier way to remove and replace the jets so anyone can do it in under five minutes.",2 months ago
169,170,6470010,Sanman,4,Professional printer,"Easy setup and no drip Ink wells. The print quality is perfect after setup and alignment, this is a high quality printer",3 months ago
170,171,6470010,Beuge,4,Good Performing Little MFP,"Unboxing the Epson EcoTank ET-3850 printer, you’ll find the printer itself, a full compliment of Epson ink bottles, a power cable, and documentation & driver CD. Despite the availability of the options on the printer, there is no ethernet cable or USB cable included. The printer has a very small footprint at only 13” x 14”.

Setting up the printer itself is an easy, though prolonged, process. Once the printer is unpacked and the app installed to your computer or mobile device, you must use the keyed bottles to fill the ink reservoirs. Each bottle will take approximately 75 seconds to transfer. Then the unit will begin charging the ink system, which takes 10 minutes. 

With the system charged, you must now complete the head alignment process. This part of the setup prints out 4 separate pages with patterns that you must eyeball and choose the best option from. The alignment is a strikingly manual process that many other printers have handled automatically for many years.

At this point, you can start printing with little additional work. Android 11 devices in my home on the same wifi automatically found and suggested the printer without any downloads or setup. And Windows 10 computers added the printer easily when using the “Add Printer” process.

Print quality for both documents and photos has been very impressive with sharp edges, solid colors, and dark blacks. Output is fast both from mobile and desktop and operation is quiet. And 2-sided printing worked quickly and reliably. 

To perform scanning will take additional setup. I needed to download the Epson ScanSmart app from their website onto my desktop. This installed a series of utilities to my computer, including an System Updater and Event listening service (for the scan to desktop functionality).

Once the programs were setup, scanning operations were quick and easy when initiated by either the computer or scanner. Results were impressive with quick operation, sharp images and good color representation. The document feeder, which only works with 1-sided pages, performed reliably with straight images and no jams.

A few additional observations: 
- The paper tray is a bit of an annoyance as there is no adjustable stop to keep the paper tight against the back edge. So, if you load something small like 4x6 photo paper and insert the drawer too quickly, the paper will slide back. 
- There is no manual feed tray. 
- Ink costs, for me at least, are going to be significantly reduced. (versus my existing 10+ year old inkjet).",2 months ago
171,172,6470010,Orion,5,Saves the environment and my wallet! Win-Win,"The Epson EcoTank ET 3850 All in One printer arrived securely packaged in a nice box with everything needed to get set up.

There is a warning in the instruction booklet that says not to touch the ink tubes and their translucent cover. I didn’t see this warning when removing the blue tape from the various areas on the printer, but fortunately didn’t remove the translucent cover. But I did touch the ink tubes, hopefully that won’t cause any damage over time. There is a power plug on the back of the unit that sticks out an extra inch, it would have been nice for this to have been

Setup was really easy. The instructions show a three prong plug, but it’s a 2 prong plug. After you plug the printer in you download the app to get started. 

Upon setup the app acts like a chat window with a smart AI, “Epson Smart Panel” that guides you and chats with you. The app/phone will find the printer after you turn it on. Once found, you fill the ink tanks. The app has you agree to a couple simple rules, then sends info to the printer which takes approx. 20 seconds. 
After that the next steps are all displayed on the app, which are filling the ink tanks.
To fill the tanks you need to open the scanner unit with both hands until it locks in place, which actually requires one hand on the base and one on the lid, to pull it into place.
Fill black in first.
Filling is really easy. You just remove the cap on the ink bottle. Line it up with the filling port and flip it over to fill. The ink bottle stands in place while the ink reservoir is filled. You do not need to push or squeeze at all, and it doesn’t seem like there is any risk of spillage at all either. The ink stops flowing from the bottle automatically once the reservoir is filled. Filling the black ink took approximately 75 seconds and I still have a small amount of black ink left in the bottle for future use.
After filling the black ink, continue with the rest of the colors, cyan, magenta and yellow.

Once all the ink is filled you close the ink lid, and the scanner unit.
The app has you verify twice that all tanks are filled before proceeding with the ink initialization. The app says that ink initialization takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
I noticed after initialization that all the ink tanks were now a little lower, probably from the ink going into the tubes.. I wonder if I can fill the rest of the ink for the bottles into the tanks now, so that I don’t have to store the bottles. .. No you cannot, when I went to fill the tanks a message appeared on the screen saying not to fill them more than ⅔ full.
While the ink initializes, the app has you connect the printer to wifi.
Once the ink is initialized, you are finished with the app and follow the instructions shown on the printer screen for the remainder of the set up.
The screen instructs you to perform a print head nozzle check and has you load paper into the paper tray.
Then you check the print head alignment, using the on screen instructions. There are 4 printer alignment tests, which require you to review printouts and select the best images.
Once the alignment tests were completed, I then checked for and installed a firmware update. 

Overall I’m extremely pleased with this printer. It’s easy to connect to, does a great job on the print quality and it prints quickly. Best of all, I won’t have to replace the ink every couple months like I’ve had to do with previous printers. This new Epson EcoTank is good for the environment and good for my wallet. I highly recommend this printer to anyone who wants a high quality printer that won’t cost an arm and a leg to maintain.",1 month ago
172,173,6470010,NJRY,5,Easy and economical printer,"A reliable, set-and-forget office printer makes an office that much more efficient. Epson's EcoTank ET-3850 is exactly what your workspace needs. The new, high capacity ink tank solution and feature-filled machine makes a perfect addition to your home office.

The first thing I noticed when unboxing this printer was the individually-wrapped ink tanks. Setup with these things was pretty easy with the included instructions, and there is an app-based manual if you are so inclined. It's an odd experience when you're used to the usual ink cartridges, but I can see how this type of ink tank would cut down on your ink replacement over time. I can really get used to this.

The tray holds around half a ream of paper, so coupled with the long-lasting ink, you're really getting a printer that's built to do its job and not cause you any extra problems. Printing, scanning, and copying all worked quickly for an ink-based printer, with some very good quality print jobs. And aside from some ink bottles that you can store for later use, there's nothing obtrusive about the size and shape of this machine. It has a nice, color screen that's easy to read and overall just really does its job well. Best of all, not only does it save you money with its cost-effective ink process, it also cuts down on cartridge waste that can reduce the burden this industry puts in our landfills.

The EcoTank ET-3850 is the printer your office needs. With user-friendly features, innovative ink solutions, and an economic and eco-friendly footprint, it's an excellent machine for any home office. Easy to recommend.

173,174,6454287,ryanmcv,4,Excellent Choice for Home Printing,"I haven't owned a printer for a few years since I've always been turned off by the high costs of ink cartridges and the clunky designs and performance of older printers. The HP ENVY 6455e shows just how far printer technology has come in just a few years. It has a sleek, minimalist design and does everything I need as a home user (with occasional work-from-home needs). I was skeptical of the HP+ and Instant Ink programs, but it seems like this setup will actually save me money in the long run.

=== SETUP ===
- The Envy 6455e has a pretty small footprint and fits nicely on a desk or shelf. The printer has a USB port if you prefer a wired connection to your computer, but a USB cable is not included with the printer. The preferred setup method is via wireless connection through the HP Smart app for iOS or Android.
- I set up the printer through the HP Smart app and it could not have been easier. The printer connected to my Wi-Fi network without issue and was up and running in less than 10 minutes.
- My Windows 10 computers recognized the printer instantly and automatically installed the HP Smart app. No configuration required.
- Some of the advanced settings for the printer (such as networking, Bluetooth, etc.) are burried deep within the HP Smart app, and you will need the PIN that is on a sticker on the inside of the printer to access some of these settings.
- Unfortunately, you can't adjust any settings using the buttons on the printer itself -- everything is done via the HP Smart app (including adjustments to the LED light on the front of the printer).

=== PRINTING ===
- Printing quality is very good for an inkjet printer. I'm sure there are better options out there if you need professional quality photo and graphic printing, but for standard home use, it's great. I noticed zero alignment problems and no distortion in printed text or images.
- The printer supports duplex (double-sided) printing, which I was surprised to see in such a small machine.
- The paper tray only holds about 100 pages, so you might find yourself adding paper frequently if you print more than a few pages a day.
- Only letter-sized (8.5x11) paper is supported, but you can print many sizes of envelopes (up to #10 size).
- Printing speed is pretty quick, but this is not designed for high-volume printing. Noise levels are about what you'd expect from an inkjet while printing -- not quiet, but not loud either.
- The ink cartridges seem very small (at least the included ones). My guess is that they will only last about 100-200 pages before needing to be changed. Hopefully the ones sent via the HP+ Instant Ink program will be larger.

=== SCANNING ==
- Like everything else, the scanner is perfectly adequate for home use. I've scanned several black-and-white documents while working from home as well as some old photos. Everything I've scanned looks great with no distortion. Colors in scanned photos/documents seem pretty accurate if not a bit washed out.
- I prefer to scan using the HP Smart app on Windows, which allows you to easily edit and crop scans before saving them to PDF or JPG.
- The scanner supports up to 1200 dpi, which is good for a small home printer.
- The auto feeder on top of the printer works great for scanning multi-page documents. It supports up to 35 pages and surprisingly scans pages pretty quickly.

=== HP+ / INSTANT INK ===
- I'll admit I was skeptical about this program, since it seems at first to just be another subscription to keep track of. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that the instant ink plans are actually very affordable with options for light and heavy users. For as little as 99 cents a month, you can make sure you never run out of ink or have to worry about buying expensive cartridges.
- The downside to signing up for HP+ is that you have to keep your printer connected to the Internet, and you can only use genuine HP ink cartridges going forward. That means if you cancel the instant ink subscription (which you can do at any time), you can't buy cheaper knock-off brands or refill old cartridges. Given the small cost of the instant ink subscription, I'd say it's worth the trade off.
- Signing up for HP+ also unlocks the full features of the HP Smart app, allowing you to initiate print jobs from anywhere and send ""mobile faxes.""
- I don't usually recommend signing up for something that requires an ""always on"" Internet connection or locks you into using one brand's accessories. But for something like a printer -- where I just want to set it up and forget about it -- I don't mind it.

== OVERALL ===
Is this the most fully-featured printer on the market? Not by a long stretch, but that's perfectly fine. This is more than enough for most small households. I wish the printer weren't so dependent on the HP Smart app -- they could have easily included a screen allowing you to adjust some basic settings directly on the printer. But this seems to be the direction the market is moving for home printers. Luckily, the app works great on mobile and Windows, and I have very few complaints about the performance of the printer itself. Home office or other users with large print jobs should look elsewhere, but for everyone else, this one deserves a look.",7 months ago
174,175,6454287,stoptheclocks,3,Well Rounded Printer for Home/Office,"The HP Envy Pro 6455 Wireless All In One (AIO) Inkjet Printer is great for home office productivity. You can even get Ink sent to your house automatically if you wish. Here are the features:

• Setup/App
Unfortunately this was the hard part for me. I downloaded the HP app and tried to setup the printer from HP easy setup. I couldn’t get the HP printer to setup wirelessly. I tried the networks and passwords and never came up with a match. I made sure that the HP printer was matched with the Smart phone HP app on the same network. I kept getting a message that I needed to update firmware and a missing driver. It was no small task to get these 2 things working with the HP printer. After a lot of trial and error, I was finally to setup the HP Envy Pro 6455 with a USB Type B to USB Type A cable (not included). I was happy just to be connected now. The other ways you can connect are through Dual Band WiFi, Bluetooth and USB (that is what I did). 
• Printing
Printing was easy and less time consuming than the setup. The printed paper came out beautiful and sharp. The inkjet printers are known for their speed and clarity in printing. The HP Envy Pro 6455 was no different. I copied and pasted different bits of notes to a Word document. I had no issues or troubles at all. The HP printer even has an auto two sided printing feature to save on paper.
• Ink Cartridges 
HP ink No. 67 black and No. 67 color are the ink cartridges that were supplied. I had to lift up the flatbed scanner and underneath for the ink to be installed. This was a very simple task of peeling off of tape and inserting the ink cartridge longer end first. There is a black top for black ink and purple top for color ink. Make sure your printer in on! ISO (International Standards Organization) rates the color per minute at 7 pages and in black at 10 pages. These speeds help you stay on task with your printing projects.
• Copy/Scan
After printing a test page, the HP printer told me to scan it. So I placed the print page (Printside down) on the scanner. It worked quickly and printed out the test page for aligning and ink saturation. Copying pages was a breeze as from printing several pages to scanning to copy a page. No problem or issues there. The flatbed scanner resolution is up to 1200 x 1200 dpi while the color resolution is up to 4800 x 4800 dpi. I scanned in a color picture and printed it off on glossy paper. It turned out really well. I have included the pics in my photos. Another feauture which is very helpful is borderless printing. There is no need to cut off the edges if there is not any!
• Auto Document Paper Feeder
At the bottom of the HP printer is located a paper tray. Slide out the tray to add 100 pages of paper to the printer. You can also add paper to the top of the HP printer. Place the paper in the upper tray and it will go through the paper feeder to be printed on.
• Control Panel
There are several ways to run the HP printer from the control panel. There are 7 icons that guide you to do what you want with the printer. The symbols are: Information, Cancel, Resume, Copy, Power, Wireless Setup and ADF Error. There are instructions on how to use the control panel in the manual on the HP website. 

Overall this is a great HP printer for copying, scanning, printing, the HP app and high capacity paper tray. The pages print fast in color or B&W. I am overall happy with the HP ENVY Pro 6455 AIO printer, but disappointed I couldn’t get the app to run.",1 year ago

The HP Envy 6455e is no exception: It produces high, inkjet quality prints. Consequently, your decision should probably be driven by *features* and *price*.

When selecting this printer, I was looking outside of my normal ""home office"" criteria as this printer ultimately is not for me. It will be handed down to my college student this fall as a basic, fallback printing/scanning option should he need it in his apartment. Thus, my criteria was ""inexpensive, entry-level printer with decent ink prices with a very low (anticipated) duty cycle."" 

***Features: ""Minimally robust.""

If I am being 100% honest, HP's approach is not for me. I have worked in IT for over 25 years and have literally serviced, purchased and installed hundreds of printers. I have seen installation processes change, quality improve, features enhanced...but I feel like HP took a step backwards with their ""minimalist"" approach to printer interaction.

I do not like the lack of an LED display screen on this printer. Nor do I like that I cannot see what the 6 icons (oh wait, there is a 7th icon if you count the digital number display) are at all times. Nor can you touch them unless they want to be touched (i.e. if you put an object on the glass, the copy icon will light up). Call me old-fashioned, but I don't want to be forced to use my phone or laptop to configure my printer/scanner/copier actions when I am standing at the device. For example: If I want to scan a document to Google Drive from the printer, I want a touchscreen ON THE PRINTER that gives me that option--I don't want to have to pull out my phone and ""beam"" the instructions to the printer.

That being said, there are a LOT of features available through the app--an app can be installed on Windows, iOS and Android devices with relative ease via the 123.hp.com website or your app store. One potentially useful feature...that I have not yet mastered...is the ""hold your print job"" service (Private Pickup). I can see value in a feature where you can send a job to the printer but not have it print until you are standing at the device. At the same time, I question if you really need that functionality on a ""home"" printer. Private printing is more of a business service. [Full disclosure: I tried Private Printing a Google Photos image from my phone multiple times and failed each time. Probably my fault, but maybe not. I quit exploring the feature after 4 fails.]

***Price: ""Average price for an entry-level printer.""

The price of this AIO is reasonable. 

Price per print is average if you are buying OEM ink at retail prices. At $30 for the black+color package with estimated 120pg yield black and 100pg yield color you should spend around 25¢/pg ($30/120pages) mixed content. To be fair, though, assessing a ""per page"" price to home printing is a crap shoot.

With the HP+ Instant Ink service, the price per page game changes and gets confusing. The HP+ Instant Ink service is NOT something I plan on keeping after the trial period because I just don't think the printer will get that much use in our household. Nonetheless, I signed up for the service without much of an idea of what I was doing. 

I picked the 99¢ plan based on how little we print. I guess that means that if I print ~12 pages per month I will run out of ink in ~10 months. I will have spent $10 on my ink subscription. They will ship the ink to me and I saved essentially $20 over the $30 black+color bundle ""off the shelf"" price? Seems like a bargain, until maybe it is not on months where I go over? I don't understand the overage fees. I did see that I can ""rollover"" up to 45 pages of overage in my plan but again, seems confusing. I must be getting old.

***Overall Experience: ""The HP Envy 6455e is an AIO printer that performs adequately but is a bit sluggish.""

From the moment I broke the tape seal on the box to the moment I printed my first document from my laptop took about 20 minutes. Initially, I was confused by the lack of buttons and displays on the printer but once I realized everything about this printer starts with an app (accessible via 123.hp.com) I was able to connect the printer to wifi via the app seamlessly. Should you not have instructions handy, the printer will generate them for you once you have paper and ink loaded. Nonetheless, the app is an evil necessity of this printer...which again, is a foreign and frustrating concept to me. [Note: My instruction printout was poorly aligned. During the initial setup process the printer generates a ""test pattern"" that you place on the glass to clean up alignment issues via voodoo, lasers and magic. In my second image you can see that output following the alignment is fine.]

Regardless, 20 minutes after unboxing I could print from my phone or laptop.

As for the things I cannot stand aside from having to control everything via an app because HP didn't include an on-device display/control screen? The printer has ""ground effect"" lights that I have not figure out how to turn off. This printer is constantly glowing which I find annoying. It also ""plays sounds"" when jobs finish which is totally unnecessary.

***Pros:
- Small footprint
- Quiet
- Mobile printing
- ADF (auto document feeder--for scanning/copying)
- Duplex printing
- Dual band wifi
- Up to 1200dpi scanning (but only 300dpi copying)
- Scan to cloud/email (via app--again, no LED screen on printer to scan direct to cloud/email from the printer)
- ""Self-healing wifi"" (not sure what that means, but I assume it just means it stores settings to reconnect to wifi/devices if they go offline)

***Cons:
- Holds about 5 sheets of paper in the paper tray. (Not really, but the paper tray is only about .5"" deep and HP claims up to 100 sheets of paper but I question that number) 
- Maxes out at 9 copies per session
- Doesn't support ""oversized"" papers but accepts letter, A4, 4x6, 5x7, 8x10 and #10 envelopes
- Constantly illuminated (as shown in other review posts)
- Tri-color ink cartridge means you are undoubtedly throwing out excess of the other two colors when one color runs out
- No on-printer display screen

Notes:
- Manual duplex scanning
- Enlarge and reduce options
- Not the fastest inkjet printer I have used, but adequate for home/infrequent printing
- White devices usually turn yellow over time

If you don't mind using an app to do anything beyond simple printing, this inkjet is as good as any--especially if you prefer a subscription ink service over buying your own. Given the HP Instant Ink is essentially a ""flat rate"" plan (they don't appear to separate color ink from black ink in their subscription plan) I can see benefits especially if you do a lot of color printing.

If the idea of an ink subscription service annoys you...or the idea of having to use an app to control the features of your printer annoys you...then consider looking elsewhere.",7 months ago
177,178,6454287,SL7977089,5,Just another good printer,"In my daily work, I work with several brands of printers. I have HP Envy 4520 for long time now with no issues at all. Its doing the job amazingly and every day. HP also doing great job on their instant ink program. Having it on all my HP printers and no complains at all. Very thoughtful and wisely priced.
Back to this Envy Pro 6455: It is a newer model with the same high quality product and accurate printing. Setting it up was very easy using the phone app (I did it using iOS and repeated it with Android). iOS seems to get it easier but both did the job. After installing the printer and connecting it to the WiFi, it is ready to work...
It is fairly quite and smooth printing and scanning. HP honestly did great on that. The Envy Pro 6455 has minimalist interface which honestly not really appreciated (by me at least) I like when they have the comprehensive LCD for more access and stand alone functionalities. This printer would require the use of a smart phone device to do the job properly.
Scanner glass is well placed. Scanning paper feeder is working nice. in the 2 days usage, I never had a jam. It seems to do the job properly. I had the printer installed in a farther corner of the office (reasonably away from wifi router) and it was able to connect without issues.
Phone app interface is really easy to use and working fairly fine. I have all the HP printers linked and I can monitor them all. It even alerts about low paper before you run out.
Back to Instant Ink, HP is offering the starting program for about $3 a month for 50 pages with unused rollover up to 100 pages. After that you pay about $1 per 10 pages when you go over. All that while offering high (HP original) Ink and after sale support in case the cartridge have issues (it happened once in the 3 years).

HP offers free 24 months of mobile fax with this Envy Pro 6455. It might be something some people like to have. I tried to mess around it and it looks like you can only send faxes but can't receive. It would definitely be more useful if it works both ways. Any way, it is a service that you might need one day. Some institutes still use fax only to send documents...

I would recommend this for daily usage. Good for printing small to average quantity of pages daily. Good and fast WiFi link connection. Fast scanning to computer and relatively quite printing.
Fashionable lights and minimalist control (LCD would be better).",1 year ago
178,179,6454287,ThikDee,5,An Amazing All In One Wireless Printer,"Great All In One Printer for my everyday use, since the pandemic I started school online and was looking for a great printer to meet all of my needs. I must say my  HP Envy Pro 6455 is the best purchase I’ve mad so far. I also love the fact that it's wireless and have an HP ink program that let's me know when I need to order more ink and I get it delivered right to my front door.",1 month ago
179,180,6454287,vortex0007,4,Like the box says... great for everyday printing.,"The hardest part about the unboxing and setup of the the HP Envy 6455e All-in-One printer is getting the ink cartridges added. I’m use to the HP OfficeJet Pro lineup which use a long thin ink cartridge, usually one cartridge per color, instead of the Envy’s two short fat cartridges. On the ink cartridge holder, there’s a plastic flap that you lift while you awkwardly angle and push in the two cartridges until they kind of snap into place, at which point the plastic lid slides down creating a type of cradle to keep them in place. If you can get this part correct, the rest of the product is a breeze to setup.

The Envy is the first printer I’ve had in twenty-five years that does not come with a display screen. The Envy uses a smart control panel where buttons appear only when needed. This technology didn’t work all that well during the initial setup process, specifically during the printer alignment step. During this phase of setup a page is printed then needs to be scanned. Pressing the scan button that lit up did nothing. Eventually the printer hit some type of internal timeout and the button flashed a couple of times, I pressed the scan button a couple more times and eventually the printer figured out how to scan the document and complete the alignment setup process. Post setup, a firmware update was installed and no similar problems have occurred so make sure you get that firmware update installed.

Adobe released the 2020 Coloring Book the day before the printer arrived so I downloaded this 72-page 800MB PDF from Adobe: https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/discover/article/adobe-coloring-book-2020. Printing this thing two-sided on HP’s premium photo paper would be a great test case for the Envy. 

I started by trying to print a single page from the Coloring Book and the result was an 8.5 X 11 full page of solid black ink. It was not what I was hoping for, but this accident illustrated that the Envy is not all that great when it comes to large solid black prints, as the printer suffers from banding see Image number 1 included.

Image number 2 of a three-eyed woman was printed on an HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw using the same paper used with the Envy. Notice the black sky is solid black with no banding. Looking at the same image printed with the Envy in image number 3, the banding presents heavily in the sky, but the remainder of the document looks crisp. 

Image number 4 of the mermaids is the LaserJet, Image number 5 is the Envy. They are almost identical and the Envy does great with small patches of black. The bottom line here is that the Envy is great for everyday printing, but is not a printer I would turn to if you plan to print photos.

Note that the images you are seeing here were printed, then scanned using the Envy’s automatic document feeder and the HP Smart App for macOS with the default resolution of 300dpi

Print quality aside, the double-sided printing feature had the 72 page coloring book printed in around 15 minutes. Approximately 4 minutes of that total time was the printer giving the ink about 6-8 seconds to dry before pulling the page back over to flip on the other side. It’s not the fastest printer around but I’ll take quality of printing over speed any day of the week. 

Without an LCD to display warning and errors, the printer comes with a speaker that emits all kinds of musical chimes to alert you to activity including inserting or removing paper into the 35-page automatic document feeder (ADF). The ADF is not particularly fast or slow but worked well and the speaker emits loud enough sounds to get my attention when necessary. 

The last area I’ll comment on is HP Plus. HP’s subscription service to assist with automatic ink cartridges when necessary. The day after printing the 72-page coloring book, the single black page, and nothing else, I opened up the HP Smart App (version 12.6.2 (552) from my macOS and the app displayed a warning that the ink levels are low. Closing the app, rebooting the macOS and then re-opening the HP Smart app results in no warning sign about the ink levels, but Image 5 shows you the current estimated ink levels. I’m feeling ignorant as I’m not sure why printing 73 pages of black results in the color ink cartridges being used at all, but it will be interesting to see when this printer actually triggers a new cartridge to be ordered. If you do sign up for HP Plus, HP indicates that the ink cartridges you receive will include MORE ink than what you get by going to a retailer, and I hope more ink than what comes in the box as the starter set of ink.",7 months ago
180,181,6454287,PhillipB,5,Great simple multifunction printer.,"Easy to use. Easy to setup. 

This multifunction printer is great for home use. 

Ink install was easy. Just follow the program steps and you are set.

Setup on Android Pixel 3XL was a snap. Setup on my kids chrome books was easy.

The 6 months of HP+ required me to enter my payment info. Ok. Was not too fond of that but at least it will cover me for 6 months. Fyi I have another printer enrolled in HP+ and they just sent me ink for that other printer. I did not have to do anything. Pretty nice. And it was within my 6 months so it was free. Nice.

HP did finally hear my complaint which was to fix their software bugs. I just got an update on Android and it looks like the interface is much better and remembers my phone or kids chromebook when updates occur and does not make it a pain to look for the printer again and again. So thanks HP.

The printer itself is sleek. It has a nice LED light and has a modern look.

Print quality it decent for an ink jet. Based on size of inkjet cartridges you will go through ink cartridge pretty fast so be aware of this as part of your consideration.

Based on what I have seen, I would recommend this product for simple home use. Hope HP keeps up with their software interface.

Only con was that my first print out the paper jammed. It might have been operator error. After I cleared it I printed out several other items and no jam.",7 months ago

183,184,6454287,Christopher,5,For the right person,"I have owned, tested, or used so many printers in my life that it is hard to get worked up for ""Another printer"". However, after playing with the Envy 6455 Pro I find it quite charming. The app download for my phone as well as the installation of the driver app on my computer were both quick and easy. The scan to feature HP offers is top of the line and for a free device it rivals other top paid editors that are available. The print quality is perfect with crisp coloring and sharp detail. I will say this unit prints slower than its predecessor the 5500 but again it does print much cleaner. Long short, this is a great little printer, but I think this is a great little printer for the ""Right"" user. If you are looking to print volumes and volumes of pages, then I might suggest the 9000 series. I think this one would be great for a student or occasional use printer. The one thing that is what I referred to as the “Charming” aspect, is the general ambiance it the unit provides. I was wowed by the ambient lighting and cute little chimes of this envy and this is what makes me envision it in a dorm room or kitchen desk. They also removed the touch screens that have become common place and opted for simplicity. I know this is a bit retro in thought, but I think the touch screens tend to be too small and hard to navigate. Again, I have several printers laying around but for our home and the quantity of printing needs we actually have I made this jewel our everyday go to. In addition, I found another novel showcase on the Windows 10 app Play & Learn that takes you to HP’s website and has a wonderful selection of things you can print.

185,186,6454287,TheHipsterTechie,1,Missed the Mark,"The digital renaissance spurred by digital cameras in the early 2000's created the D.I.Y home printing phenomena. As cameras became more advance, printers and ink continued to be expensive. So much that cartridges continue to be a home office manager's budget nightmare. Honestly, I was reluctant at first in obtaining a new printer since the expense cost associated with cartridge printers continue to baffle me. Enter the HP Smart program with Insta Ink, an innovative experiment to keep customers from buying new printers and to share the printing costs through a membership program that allows for the manufacture to know your printing needs thru real time automation. While noble, there are opportunities with HP ENVY 6455. I am going to focus this review on my experience in printing photos only. 

My first impression when taking it out of the box was favorable. The printer is not too tall and bulky as most scanner printers in the market. This is a low profile scanner.
I utilized there HP Smart app, both thru my new Dell laptop and also thru two different smart phones (android and iPhone), and photo paper. I must say that was the easiest app to setup and use. The quality of print output thru my wife's Samsung phone was surprising better than from my laptop, however, her phone did not offer a photo size in the menu options menu, this is a key opportunity for HP's smart app developer's. When printing from my laptop, I was able to choose the size of my photo size print. However, the results from printing from my laptop was disappointing. There were subtle vertical cartridge streaks. Is there a thing? I’ll include an image from an upload of what I mean by vertical lines. That brings me to the only positive thing on this ENVY 6455. The scanner works. It facilitated the opportunity to share with you the vertical streaks. Wow! Not happy with the printing results, but the scanning was amazing. You’ll get to see my disappointment on the poor photo quality. 

I bought in to the digital renaissance in hopes to be more efficient with my hard copy output in photo printing, however new printers such as ENVY 6455 are built on old cartridge engineering. I get that HP is wanting to gain a foothold with their automation service model, however, that comes at the consumer cost by surrendering more of our privacy and wallet upfront for convenience. Not sure if I’d like to return for seconds when I did not obtain satisfactory printing results in the first place from ENVY 6455. It does beg the question, why have printers continue to be the most replaceable hardware in computer peripherals? I believe now is the best time for consumers to ask for a better printing experience through a complete relook on quality output and not get suckered into a monthly fee service for ink.

Summary:
An adequate inkjet printer with reliable quality and speed.

Pros:
* Price. Not an expensive printer if you factor in the 6 months of InstantInk. The more you print the more value.
* Form Factor. An appropriately sized printer for its functions.
* Connectivity. There are various methods to send print jobs to this printer. Bluetooth, AirPrint, and via the networked device.
* Mobile App. The mobile app helps you do some frequent things. It is handy, not sure it's necessary, but it is handy. It is a bit wonky in navigating to different pages. In some cases, though, it doesn't know it is open and forces you to log out or close and re-open the app.

Cons:
* Quality. Print quality isn't great for images. Even on glossy paper. You can very clearly see banding. I tried a few types of paper. 
* No LCD. I didn't think this was going to be a problem. But it is. The flashing color light is nice as effects, but not as an indicator of status. I have to keep a reference sheet or lookup online or in the app. Not too helpful. A simple LCD would have sufficed.
* Setup/Installation. Not easy for someone with low to moderate technical expertise. More on this later.
* Price. Also a con. Even though it seems competitively priced, I feel since this is a supply profit-driven product, they could have stood to add that pesky status LCD.
* Auto-shipped Ink. Great concept. I was just sent new ink. I'm not sure why. I'm not sure if part of the bundle. I haven't printed many pages so it isn't used.
* Auto-shipped Ink! One thing that stood out in the documentation is that ink is sent based on printed pages. Not available ink. So if you print a lot, you'll see ink show up when you need it. I assume then that not printing means you'd see fewer shipments. I would like a notification and a requested approval when this happens. I didn't see anything for the first shipment, but I hope there is one for the next. Not so much an issue while in the 6 months free/included period, but probably something others may not like beyond that. Oh, you'll need to keep a credit card on file with HP, too. If they did notifications/approvals, they could have used Apply Pay or something for subscription or individual approved purchases.
* Short-Cuts interface is wonky. It showed all of them grayed out implying they weren't available. But that is just the shading selected for the toggle. I tried configuring the OneDrive shortcut for a ""scan to OneDrive"" use case. But the permissions HP wants are insane. They want access to anything that the owner of the OneDrive account has access to and that isn't acceptable. I use this type of feature on my Brother MFC (which required replacement) and it was not like that at all. You specify a folder and that is it. Needless to say, short-cuts like these won't be used. I'll have to keep using my more bulky laser printer (in the garage) to scan things to the cloud.

Use:
The printer performs as expected. I was hoping for a printer my partner could use to work with photos. You know scrapbook, not super high-quality demands. No commercial use. With respect to text-oriented content with limited graphics, it does work great. But when it comes to larger images on various media, it doesn't do as well as I'd hoped. There is banding along with the image. I think I'll have to use my color laser printer for images that require better though not photo-realistic output as think the inkjet printer is not an improvement.

Initially, I unboxed the unit and I asked my partner to try and set it up. I wanted to see if someone with low-moderate technical expertise could do it. After 30 minutes, he couldn't. So I stepped in. The instruction can be used, but they aren't so clear - partly because of the light strip indicator. If you're colorblind, this might be a problem. Additionally, it periodically loses connectivity to a wireless router that isn't 10 feet away in the same room. Meanwhile, my workhorse laser printer is on another floor and has no issue.

I've owned other HP printers (remember the DeskJets!?), I've even provided technical support for them at one point in my career. These printers don't seem to print better than they do, even if the ink carriage assembly is less bulky.

I wish now that I had selected to replace my trust Brother with another Brother. But I thought HP might be something different to try since my inkjet printing needs aren't as demanding. But even considering its multi-function capabilities, I don't think it stands out.",5 months ago

The Out of Box to first print was less than 20 mins. Granted I already had the HP Smart app. loaded and I did work for HP San Diego (where this printer was designed) for 35 years. Regardless HP has come a long ways with the HP Smart application and out of box experience (my only issue is the sticker on the cover was difficult to remove and left a ton of adhesive). 

With HP+ I received an extra year of warranty and 6 months of free printing with new ink on the way via the HP Instant Ink program. The rating was based on first impressions and experience plus what I see as a good value for the money.

I understand that dropping off wireless has been corrected and I like the look and feel of the printer without the control panel. With all of our devices already on hand, why not reduce the cost of the printer by eliminating the standard user interface. The visual lighting features are pretty intuitive.

190,191,6454287,justjoshin93,3,simple printer for most people,I had gotten this printer because my HP Officejet Pro 7612 Wide format died suddenly (print head issues) and needed a replacement while I get my printer fixed. I went to my local best buy and saw that this was all they had in stock and  everything else was on back order for about a week or so. So I had no other choice and decided to buy it. I'm not a fan of ink used in this device (HP 67 to be exact). The tri-color is one cartridge and then black for the other. They have given me problem with an early printer I had from HP. I feel this one might do the same. I've printed a few documents and a few photos so far and they are pretty decent not flashy or such. The color of the printer is nice but there is no screen. I kinda like the led light bar it has in the front. The setup sucks you have to have a smart phone and download the HP smart Application (available on the Apple App store and Google Play Store) and make sure you have a reliable wireless connection (Wi-Fi).

191,192,6454287,JC1503,5,Envy is right!,"I absolutely love this printer and my spouse is totally envious of it as well. Very appropriately named.

It is so sleek and stylish from the ambient lighting when it is printing to the touch interface that is practically invisible until you need it. That is so cool. At first, I was a little freaked out that it did not have a traditional touch screen. I was thinking, “how am I going to print or copy if I don’t have a touch screen interface?” Well you do have one… if you put a document in the auto feeder or the glass it lights up on the front of the printer for a color copy or black and white copy (see pic)! Otherwise you don’t even notice it…SLEEK!

I also really liked the HP “smart app” HP has developed. I also have an HP Office Jet Pro so I have the Smart app from that but with the Envy, I really dug into it more. It’s also easy to have multiple HP printers in the app and as easy as a single swipe to change from one printer to the next. It is super easy to use and really allows the Printer to become more of a smart printing appliance than just a dumb copy print box. It can print from my photos, or my documents, scan, even camera scan from my phone. With the app and an account, I can easily work from my phones, laptops and tablets all with ease. I also was a little hesitant to sign up for HP plus but with the ink promotion, I did it. You can cancel anytime. You get an extra year of warranty and never have to worry about running out of ink. 

Looks great and has a great app but how does it print?? AMAZING. Again, I love the ambient light when it prints and the nice little melody it plays when it’s done. HP is world class printing and scanning and they get better and faster every year! Fast double sided and auto fed! This truly is the perfect all in one for a modern home office or for kids homework! 

And finally set up? It goes back to the smart app. It’s fun to watch the app talk to the printer and everything just connect and work…so easy which means that there is some great programmers working at HP. Note: don’t rush the printer and app during set up even though you may think nothing is happening it is just setting everything up in the back ground.

193,194,6478251,Cupra,5,Really Impressive Home Printer,"I recently upgraded my printer to the HP ENVY Inspire 7955e. This is a functional looking machine finished in white and sandstone recycled plastic. The machine consists of over 45% recycled parts, making it a very eco-friendly choice. 

The tilt adjustable contextual color touchscreen display on the front is intuitive, responsive and informative. Very useful indeed for navigating the options on the printer. Print, copy, scan, all wirelessly!

The printer was a little more challenging to initially set up than my previous HP Envy Photo 7855. First, you need to remove the packaging tape and the cardboard inside. I started the set up using the instructions provided in the quick start guide, but I left the top of the printer open after removing the cardboard, expecting to be prompted to insert the ink cartridges, but instead, the HP Smart App set up timed out on both the printer and the app (iPhone 12 Pro) and I had to restart both. I finally realized that I needed to have the top closed on the printer for the set up to complete, where then I was prompted to open the lid and clip in the included printer cartridges. I would have thought that the app might have prompted me that set up wouldn't continue until the cover was closed. So just be aware of that issue. I loaded some paper and started the printer calibration which only took a moment. This was the only challenge I had with the printer over the last week. 

I've had the 'HP Smart' app on my iPhone for a couple of years now, and did all the set up of the new printer from there, adding it to my account. Bluetooth connectivity is great, meaning, yes, I can print directly from my phone. I know it's not a new thing, but it really is a convenient feature, especially if you have a document emailed to you, you can print it directly from your phone instead of having to fire up your computer!

And that is what I did first. Loaded up some 8.5""x11"" paper and sent a photo of a recent logo I created to print. It printed quickly, and silently, within about 30 seconds, it was all done. The print? A very smooth transition between the banding, smooth color transition and overall great ink coverage on a very porous paper (meaning it absorbs the ink which can reduce the vibrance of the colors), Printing on the included gloss photo paper samples netted a really vibrant and crisp image. I've printed from my iPhone 12 Pro and my Apple iMac, a 2014 model running Big Sur with no issues at all. Full functionality within my print settings, and seamless wireless connectivity and printing. I've also printed from my HP Spectre laptop, from the room upstairs, above my office, and had no issues with the wireless connectivity or print quality. Really smooth experience! 

One of the challenges with home printers is the ink. How many times have you gone to make that 'urgent' print and your ink has all dried up and won't print a page correctly. With the HP+ program you get 6 months of 'Instant Ink', where HP will send you ink based on the amount of usage the printer gets. I have signed up for the full plan, which starts at $0.99 a month, and goes up from there depending on the amount that you print per month. This should hopefully alleviate the pain of running out of ink! And with the HP+ subscription you also get an additional 2 years of warranty on your printed and additional access to the advanced features in the HP Smart App. And just like the printer, when you are sent new ink cartridges, HP sends you a prepaid envelope to recycle the old printer cartridges. 

Overall, this is a nice, feature packed, well-built machine, that I would recommend to my friends. A welcome addition to my home office!",1 week ago
194,195,6478251,Naztynestor,5,excellent printer!,"- so far im very satisfied with HP Envy Inspire printer you can copy and print, not only that it can also be controlled through smart phone if you ever wanted to print pictures or files
- majority of the body of HP Envy are plastic, so make sure to be careful moving this or placing this printer
- after opening the package HP also include ink for you to use right away, also if you go though the paper that came inside the packages inside you will find a free photo paper you can use for printing your personal photos 
- it does have the ability to be connected through wifi, which most modern printer supports 
- setting it up for the first time will require you download the app on your phone, but you can also set this up using your computer, but from my experience I did it through my iphone
- the printer also have a built in touch screen, it can also be tilted if you prefer that, but from the screen you can also use the copy/ scan and there’s also a shortcut section that can be customize through the app
- printing speed is also pretty fast when printing regular black letter files, im current putting it to the test by printing over 166 pages of my study guide, so far it’s moving fairly quickly 
- I do wish that app should stay as an alternative way to set up the printer, for me to proceed I have zero choice until I download the app either on your phone or computer. connecting through the internet I thought was already enough, but then having the app just to finish setting it up is something I don’t agree with
- overall the application will also give you some kind of alert if the printer requires certain step to get it going, I do like that a lot 
- overall I think it’s a solid printer that offer great features you can use specially if you currently working from home, I think this HP envy printer is good for you.",1 week ago
195,196,6478251,TheOffice1234,5,HIGH QUALITY COLOR MFP FROM HP 7955e,"REVIEW: HP - ENVY INSPIRE 7955E WIRELESS ALL-IN-ONE INKJET PRINTER WITH 6 MONTHS OF INSTANT INK INCLUDED WITH HP+ - WHITE & SANDSTONE

MODEL: ENVY INSPIRE 7955E

HIGH QUALITY COLOR MFP FROM HP - 7955e

The HP - ENVY INSPIRE 7955E has great print quality and is plenty fast, but man is this thing loud when printing at full speed. There is a quiet mode that can be enabled to slow things down a bit and it works well. Anyway, the prints and copies are very good. 

For best scanning results download the stand-alone HP drivers specifically for the HP - ENVY INSPIRE 7955E instead of HP SMART APP. [HP is now calling this OFFLINE Installation] This give you much more control of the scanning quality and the results are vastly improved. Run the HP SCAN app instead of the HP SMART APP.

The full color touch screen is great and it even has a copy preview mode where you can see a thumbnail of what you are about to copy. Very cool.

This newer designed printer does a great job of keeping a small footprint with all the various input and out trays tucked away when not in use.

Sure everyone wants more paper tray capacity, but for home / small office use it is fine and does not overwhelm a small desk or side table. Because it is wireless you really can put it just about anywhere in your home / office out of sight if you wanted.

SETUP:
I don’t know if was related to recent outages on the net, but I found the automatic setup would hang and I had to setup much of the printer manually. I never received step by step instruction from the HP SMART APP. In my case a few reboots of both the printer and the computer eventually got everything installed through the HP SMART APP. Once that was completed (and I activated HP+ and Instant INK) everything worked perfectly.

SCANNING
NOTE: THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC 2 SIDED (duplex) SCANNING: Even though this prints on both sides it does not automatically scan or copy on both sides. 

PRO’s
- Really Attractive Printer, I love the new color scheme 
- GREAT Print Quality DUPLEX Printing
- GREAT Color and B&W Copy Quality
- GREAT SCANS – But only with the dedicated scanning software not SMART APP
- USB port that can be used after the setup is complete.

FOR HP+ / E-INK
You need to crunch the numbers for yourself to see if this makes sense for you. If you primarily use HP brand ink or toner, then you might as well save some money with the HP+ line of printers.

SUMMARY / RECOMMENDATIONS
It is not the cheapest option from HP, but if you want fast quality color and high resolution scans, I can make a strong case for the ENVY INSPIRE 7955E. If you do a lot of scanning, especially if you want automatic 2 sided scanning, then maybe look at some higher end models. For every day printing and great printing as well as scanning when occasionally needed, then ENVY INSPIRE 7955E is perfect.",5 days ago
196,197,6478251,DaveW,5,Solid Home Office Print Station,"The HP Envy 7955e printer is a new all-in-one (AIO) wireless printer from HP and is a complete refresh of the 7855. The AIO includes copying, scanning, and printing. It also utilizes HP’s Instant Ink Program, which has been retooled a bit this year – the first 6 months are free, and then a subscription plan is needed. The box contains the ink needed, a power cord, a getting started sheet, and the printer. I have another HP Envy printer – the 6055e, which is like a little brother to the 7955e, so I am interested in seeing what the main differences are.

Comparing the 7955e to my 6055e is not really apples to apples. The 7955e is a decently larger machine that compares in size to my laser printer. I’m not unfamiliar with larger AIO’s, so this isn’t new territory for me. There is a physical power button on the machine located just above the touch screen. Other than that all other controls are through the touch screen or on your computer/phone via the HP Smart app. The paper tray holds up to 125 sheets while the auto-feeder 35. The paper tray is kind of interesting in that it has 2 layers in which to load paper. The bottom layer is for larger sizes and can range from 3.85” wide to 8.5” and will feed paper lengths from 5” up to 14” (the tray has a flip down door that allows the longer sheets to stick out). The top layer of the tray appears to be geared towards photos and smaller print sizes. It has pre-marked adjustment points for 4x6, 5x5, and 5x7. The spec sheet does say this tray doesn’t support custom media sizes. There is also has a little reminder image to show you which side to lay your photo paper down. The autofeed tray adjustment guide takes 8.5” wide down to 4.75”. Pages running through the autofeed output just below on the the top of the printer. Pages running through the main tray output to a little pull out shelf that has a angled stopper on the end of it that flips up via spring loading. The output tray can hold up to 35 sheets. The scanner/copier bed is just below the autofeed tray and has a hinged cover. The tray has marking for 8.5x11” or A4 paper – these are the largest sizes the bed will scan. The bed obviously scans one sheet at a time, so if you want to scan multiple items then you need to load via the auto tray. The only port on the printer other than the power inlet is for a standard printer USB cable to plug in – there is no network port.

Setup for the printer was straightforward. I had been through this same process with the 6055e, so it was a snap. Like the 6055e it required a smart phone with the HP Smart app installed. Once inside the app the printer was recognized right away and I had it hooked up to my Wi-Fi in no time. I was prompted to signup for HP’s Instant Ink program. With these printers they are giving you 6 months free and then after that a paid subscription kicks in. With my 6055e there were 5 levels during signup with the entry tier being free (15 prints a month) – a pretty good deal. Recently HP stopped offering the free option, but they still have 5 levels. The entry level is pretty affordable, and with 6 months free it’s a good deal in my opinion if you are a casual printer. You can check out the Instant Ink website to get some more info on pricing and print levels. You can also opt to skip the Instant Ink program and just buy the cartridges. I’d try to figure what works best for you before signing up – you have 7 days after the initial setup to decide if you want to opt into the program.

The 7955e is made positioned to be a wireless network printer for your home or small office, but it can still be tethered to a computer via a USB printer cable. It has wireless AC connectivity and is compatible with networks utilizing 2.4 or 5GHz signals. Just like my 6055e I can print to it from my PC, through the HP Smart app, or via a dedicated email address. Send it an email with the file you want printed, and you are set – you do need to enable this feature in the HP app and then assign it an email address.

I did several different print/copy/scan jobs to see what differences/improvements over my 6055e existed. Printing a text document was straightforward – print speed is up 25% (12 to 15ppm). Text is nice and sharp and no signs of any print head inaccuracies. Scanning a picture is a 2 part adventure here with the addition of the autofeed tray. Scanning on the bed proved more accurate for photos and other non-text items. For text-based documents the difference between the scanner bed and autofeed tray were minimal. I would go as far to say using the bed for documents isn’t worth the time since the autofeed tray can roll through a stack of papers without any extra steps. My one criticism of the autofeed tray is every page I scanned came out slightly crooked – like 3-5° off. Doesn’t matter much for a text document or scanning for records, but still not something you want when you try for a high-quality scan. I was able to easily scan to my computer or to my phone through both the autofeed and bed. The scanning bed resolution is 1200 DPI, while autofeed resolution sits at 300 DPI. I noticed that I couldn’t select anything higher than 300 DPI while using the mobile app though. The copy quality got a bump up to 600 DPI (compared to 300 DPI on the 6055e). If you want a higher quality copy (like a picture), then you should scan it first and then do a regular print. Regular printing resolution is 1200 DPI for black, and 4800 x 1200 DPI for color on regular paper. My 6055e requires HP Photo paper to hit the highest resolution. I did a few photo prints on 8x10 and 5x5 (sample paper included with the printer). They came out with a really great print quality to them. Colors were accurate and the image was sharp without any bleeds. I would say that the image quality is a touch better than the 6055e – not a lot of difference truth be told. However, the prints came out quite a bit quicker, which was a nice improvement. This printer does 15ppm for text/B&W, and does 10ppm for color. Pictures are slower than this – around 25s to print the 5x5. However, it is nice and quiet still so no complaints that it takes a bit longer.

I have maintained a color laser printer as my main day to day machine while WFH, and I kept the 6055e as my photo/scan station. I used it for the occasional scan, but mostly for photo prints or if the kids needed better color documents that what the laser provided. With the 7955e I can say that I will relegate the 6055e even further. It does everything better and faster, and will serve my home photo needs even more. The 7955e is also better home office companion with its higher print speed and the inclusion of the autofeed tray for scanning and copying. I am hoping the 7955e is a reliable printing platform like my 6055e has been for the last year. Overall I can’t really find any faults with the 7955e. Connectivity was easy, app has been solid, and computer interface is easy to live with. This is a good machine right out of the box.",10 hours ago
197,198,6478251,RalphHenry,5,"Excellent Printer, Super High Quality Photos","This turned out to be a fantastic multi-purpose printer. I recalled when a printer came with sprockets and paper had holes for the guide rails – wow have things improved. First of all the packaging was excellent. There was an inner box completely encased by an outer box providing double protection for the printer. The printer also had foam and cardboard providing added protection. I noticed to remove the printer from the inner box, the packaging folks at HP had come up with a sort of strong ‘strip-handle’ that you simply pulled and easily lifted the printer right out. You may recall when you had to turn the box upside down to dump out a new printer but not in this case. Tip of the cap to the engineers at HP.
I noticed the simplicity of paper size adjustments and the nicely designed printer cartridge holders. Once the various protective tape strips are removed, you plug the printer in and install the HP Smart app on your phone or computer. Just follow the directions from the app and the printer is installed in a few minutes. The app finds the printer, helps you set up wireless and away you go. Super easy.
This printer is in a little higher price point but is well worth it due to its range of functional capabilities, solid structure and excellent print quality. In short order it was installed on my laptop and on my iPad Pro. A nice feature of the install is the ability to send a link to your gmail, go to your computer and click on that link to quickly install on your computers in addition to your smart phone.
Document quality, scan quality and photo printing was great and indeed the photo printing was spectacular. I’ve included a photo with this review and the colors pop vividly.
This printer is best I’ve used and I do highly recommend it.",1 week ago
198,199,6478251,KKCNIck,5,Great Printer 6 months ink inc.,"Setup:
Plugged it in and turned it on. Had to remove the cardboard and get the tray cleared. It connected it to computer instantly.

Use:
I thought it was very fast to setup. The printing is very quick too. Came with the 2 sets of toner. I would say the print quality is good. Its kind of good that they prevent you from using it until you remove everything and put in the toners. This way the setup is correct vs breaking something by missing a piece of packaging. The app downloaded allowed me to setup buttons for scan to email and scan to One Drive. This saved a painful setup on the machine.

Cons:
Color is just ok but would be better if it was more grey than gold. Print speed could be better. Full color photo’s are a little slow.",1 week ago
199,200,6478251,DavidJr,3,"Tiny cartridge, online requirements.","Having had several printers over the years, one annoying thing is when you want to print a picture and have to remove regular paper to insert photo paper and then back when done. With this one you have a tray to keep printer paper and another for photo paper (4x6, 5x5 or 5x7). Making printing a picture between regular documents easy. As for printing pictures, it has done a pretty decent quality, as well as regular printing jobs. However, the color cartridge is a single combined cartridge and is so low after 20 pictures that HP Instant Ink sent replacements already. 

As for the HP Instant Ink plan, it reminds me of old phone plans, where you pay per page instead of per minute, even with roll over pages. In a way it can be cost effective since printing 30 or so photos would lead to needing a new color cartridge soon and it is still under the 100 page count for the default plan. However, go over the plan limit you are paying for (or 700 pages during the 6 month trial) and you have to pay more per 10-50 pages, pending your plan. Plus, if you don’t activate your trial within 7 days or cancel your plan after 6 months, the Instant Ink cartridges you have installed will quit working. Requiring you to purchase retail cartridges regardless of how much ink you have remaining. I also find it odd that when you look at the ink levels through the HP Smart app, you have to log into the HP website and still don’t get an estimate of how many pages you might have available. 

I like having multi-function printers, especially with built-in double sided capability like this one. But, I really dislike the requirements to keep it connected and limited in the pages I print per month without additional costs. I also had an issue after 30 pages that the rollers that pull the page into the printer were acting like my older printer does. Claims it is a jam when the pressure of the wheel just couldn’t pull the page in. I applied a little wheel oil that I used to fix my old printer and it is working as intended, but not something I expected in the first week. 

Overall, not a bad printer, but I can’t recommend it with its built in restrictions and the minor issue I had with it so soon.",2 days ago

201,202,6478251,bTobin,5,A great printer for everything you need,"I really hate printer shopping and trying to find the right printer for what I need. It seems like there’s always a feature missing or it’s good at one thing but not the other. Well I may have actually found a printer that can handle everything I need it to do. Ok...not everything, but the con list is pretty short. 

PROS: 
- Good photo prints
- quick printing 
- has a scanner and copier (can even SEND a fax using your cell) 
- double sided printing (but not copying) 
- the app isn’t too bad and there’s a PC option available in windows store
- connected to my network quick and easy

CONS
- no double sided copying (more details below)
- a lot of ""agree"" to this and that checkboxes and subscriptions to get all features

So like I said, not a whole lot wrong with this unit that I noticed so far. The only real problem I had with it was I assumed when it said double sided printing it meant it could take a double sided original, placed in the top feeder, and make a 2 sided copy of it. However, what it actually does is takes two original pages and puts them on 1 two sided copy. That’s not really a big deal for me, it was more of a little let down because I misunderstood what it could do. The reality is it’s not going to affect me much but maybe for someone out there, this would be helpful information. 

 But what I did really enjoy about this printer was the photo quality. I wasn’t actually expecting it to print good photos but I was pleasantly surprised to see my photos print better than ones I had ordered from a drugstore and just as good as online prints I’ve ordered. They might not print great if you try to one click it from the app on the phone or not bother to adjust settings, but if you set it to best and check over some advanced settings, you can get really good prints. Good enough to send to grandparents or put on your walls, office, etc. I also was happy with the printers over all document printing capabilities. We have an etsy shop that needs to print labels and inserts for all our orders and this printer churns them out fast.

 Speaking of printing a lot of documents and photos, what’s the worst part about printers? The ink. Buying, recycling, finding the right cartridge in that giant book. It can be a pain. But this printer works with HP+ and HP’s instant ink program. Now, I have to admit, I went full tinfoil hat on this thing and looked into it pretty close trying to figure out how yet another monthly subscription is going to screw me over. But I really struggled to find a lot of issues with the instant ink program. I definitely couldn’t find any tricks or gimmicks. It is true that it’s not for everyone, but if you go through a lot of ink for high quality prints of photos or color documents etc but don’t necessarily go through a lot of paper, you do stand to save a lot of money with the program. It works like the old cell phone plans with minutes only the printer uses page counts. So as long as you stay within your page limit for the month, you can use as much ink as you want and the printer will tell HP when to ship more so you don’t run out. If you go over your page limit, just like the old cell phones, you pay for the overages. BUT unlike the cell phones, it’s not a lot. Something like 6 cents a page. It sounds pretty cool, and this printer came with 6 months free so I’m definitely going to try it out and see. I would suggest you look into it more for the details and see if it’s right for you, but I think most people that need a beefy printer like this will also need a good amount of ink. 

OVERALL I’d say this is a great printer for any family or home office. It can scan, it can copy, it can send a fax, and oh yeah, it can print. Photos, documents, detailed color prints, it has handled it all in an easy to set up and use, all in one printer. I’m back on the HP train, this thing is solid.",1 week ago
202,203,6478251,GameOverSuckas,5,HP never lets you down!,"I tend to print photos more often the paperwork, so I went with an inkjet instead of a laser printer. I have had more HP computer and printer equipment than I can even remember, and I honestly can say it's rarely left me disappointed. This model is an all-in-one printer, copier, scanner. One note that this does not do double sided scanning. 

One feature that I did like was it had a separate tray for photo paper and adjustments for each size, 4x6, 5x7, etc. that is easily adjustable. 

I love the HP smart app! So well done and easy to use as well as setting up the printer. It also allows you to print from your phone, and if you're my age back in the day you had to take the picture... download it from the phone to your computer than print. No more of that! Take the pic, print the pic... that simple

The print quality and speed doing black and white text is exceptional! The pages shoot out fast and are crystal clear similar to what you'd get from a laser printer. Even when doing color with w thick or blocky area usually in a lot of printers you'll see lines or banding and not that smooth area with no spots or lines. This printer does seemingly well with none of that so far in my experiences.

It does print double sided even though it doesn't do the same while scanning. And it's pretty cool how it does it to where you don't have to manually flip the sheet, it basically prints one side then sucks it back into the printer by itself and prints the other side. 

Printing photos even has an option to print on both sides. So if you want to put a date or put some sort of graphic or note on the picture, you can with ease.

Over all I was very pleased with this and would highly recommend it to others",1 week ago

204,205,6478251,Christopher,5,Great for Photos,"I have tested and or owned several printers over the years. I have favored HP products since the inception of the HP smart app, not to say that I have not had wonderful printers from other manufactures, I just prefer the simplicity much like IOS. The HP ENVY Inspire 7955e is a bit of a cookie cutter iteration from aesthetics to its functionality. Out of the box the printer is well built and easy to setup. I had the printer connected to both my phone and laptop within 2 minutes. That said this printer is an at home workhorse and delivers well in all areas. I say at home because the ""Duty cycle"" of a printer is the developer’s subtle clue to the user about where & that for which the printer was actually intended. In this case, one thousand pages per month is a good bit but your actual printing volume needs should be considered when purchasing. I can print 1,000 pages in a couple of days at work. Obviously then, I chose to utilize this device in our home. Printing using the 7955e is easy to do again from the HP smart app or via the top feeder scanner or scanner itself. Printing just traditional black text documents is on par from a speed of print perspective for most all-in-one printers. Perhaps leaning towards the slower end but hardly noticeable. Printing text and color though does become noticeably slow, beautiful, but slow, nonetheless. I think where this printer actually shines though, is the studio quality photo printing. We did several 4x7's from some older cloud pictures we had of the kids and have subsequently framed them. To be truly clear here though, it is all about quality of the photo from a pixilation standpoint. We did a few quick snaps in low lighting and tried to print those. The result was honestly not great. My advice is to zoom in a bit on the picture you want to print and if the quality of the picture is withstanding and still clear, print away. Also, be mindful that this is an inkjet printer so if you plan to print color anything go ahead and opt into the HP+ package for ink because you are going to need it in droves. 
Conclusion, this HP 7955e is a solid printer that performs as advertised. 8 out of 10",1 week ago
205,206,6478251,LindaCT,5,Remarkable Printer,"I have been lucky enough to continue working from home and needed a new printer. I am also an amateur photographer. This is a great home office printer with so many features that you will use it for more than just work.

With the HP Smart App or software, setup is fairly simple. Just plug in the printer, answer a few questions on the touch screen and then install the software for your computer or you can install the app on your cell phone. Just follow the directions from the device of choice for installation.
 
The automatic document feeder is great for copying or scanning many documents at once without having to keep switching out pages you are copying. The feeder holds up to 125 pieces of paper. If you have documents that are two-sided, the feeder does that also. Printing two-sided is a BIG plus on saving money because you are using less paper. 

You only need two cartridges for your ink, the tricolor ink cartridge and the black ink cartridge. I had always used a printer with three different cartridges for my colored ink because it seemed to print photos better. This is just as good as those printers that feature three different cartridges to use for better color.

I love taking photos and printing them to display around my home. This does a great job keeping the color genuine. Another feature that I just love is that you can take pictures with your cell phone from anywhere and print them at home when you are out and about.

This printer comes with a 6-month free trial of Instant Ink. You will never worry about ink if you choose to do this. It will be delivered right to your door. They have flexible plans for your needs. HP even gives you prepaid packaging to send them your used cartridges. They know when your ink is low and will send it to you. If you print as little as 15 pages a month, it will only cost $0.99 a month. I find this very handy since I have been working from home. I don’t have to leave the house to get more ink. 

I highly recommend this specific printer because I believe HP has really thought of everyone’s needs when designing this particular printer.",1 week ago
206,207,6478251,APFLORES413,5,Nice premium home printer,"Having a home business requires a premium printer to keep up. Having the HP ENVY Inspire 7955e has been essential and a joy to have in the office. After a week of usage, here are my thoughts. 

Having been familiar with HP+ smart printing system, I needed a printer that was not only wireless but connected via this app. I found it very easy to utilize its features on any device that I have at home (Mac, iPhone, iPad, etc). Having that freedom was so necessary for my home (business and students) to use. 

I was very happy that this printer has multi-purpose features: print, copy and scan, and the additional 2-sided printing. What I do value to is the lower tray feeder. Having had printers with the back top feeder, paper would always get stuck due to gravity and I would always face a power jam. With the 7955e, I don’t have to worry about that due to lower paper tray. 

Included with this printer is the 6 months of Instant Ink with HP+. We all know at how much the ink cartridges costs, and it was a sigh or relief having 6 months free ink. My business requires ink, my kids using it for class, and for printing pictures, all are heavy ink usages. 6 months is a long time for ink replacements and HP+ is a must for anyone who uses printers as much as we do. 

Speaking of HP Smart, there are so many helpful tools there to enhance your prints. You can also manage your ink needs there as well. 

Overall, the HP ENVY Inspire 7955e is a must for any home office and student needs. So happy we picked this up.",1 week ago
207,208,6478251,Tstall,5,Printer for those who do all at home!,"First off, I really like the gold accents on this printer. You can say they kind of look tan but I like it as it is something different than your typical black or only white printer. 

Best features: 

High print quality printing. The printer is auto set to print 600 dpi but you can set it for 1200 dpi. Your pictures or documents will come out glowing!

Photo tray. This is the first printer I have seen with a built in photo tray. It is in built into the paper tray and when you load your photo paper it will take it from there rather than your tray with reg. paper. It supports up to 5x7 photo paper (I wish it was 8x10).

I like the HP smart app which is on my desktop, ipad, and iphone. I sign into my account, and I can print from anywhere. It's really great to use and is loaded with features. I have multiple HP printers and they all pop up when I open up my HP Smart app. 

Automatic 2-sided printing. I prefer 1 sided printing (always had) but for some documents you need 2 sided or if you want to save paper. This feature is a must have and I like to see it on my printer. 

My only complaint: The print does seem to make a lot of noise. When you load paper or before it prints a page, it makes all these adjustment sounds. It does have a quiet mode which you can schedule on the physical print or click the box as its printing (for an immediate) need.",1 week ago
208,209,6478251,Benb,5,Perfect for home use,"One of my favorite features is the double tray, I have 4x6 photo paper loaded on top of the 8.5x11 and I can print photos at any point I like without keeping the back tray open like on other printers. This ties into the size of the device, which is a nice compact size for all of its features: print, copy, scan, and if you order its own ink if you set it up.
The app is one of the best I’ve seen for adding to the usability of the printer, you can ‘copy’ a paper with your phone by scanning it with your phone camera. There is free random printable content like peppa the pig cutouts. There is even a digital fax part that you can set up, I haven’t had to send a fax in 4 years so a built in method to fax is a nice backup as I was driving across town before to pay someone to fax my stuff back then. I love being able to print photos straight from my phone and it working smoothly. So far the photos have all come out awesome even when I used off brand photo paper. I was also able to connect my Facebook account and print photos straight from my albums. One downside was that Facebook was the only app able to connect for me at the time of this review. But it was easy enough to download from other places and print from my local folder. The printing isn’t the absolute fastest so if you are just looking to crank out hundreds of pages then it might be worth looking at a printer that is designed for that but for regular home use this hits the spot.",1 week ago
209,210,6478251,Emmanuel,5,Great For My Home Office,"I have been looking for an all-in-one printer and I think I have found the one that checks all the boxes! I am coming from a regular printer that did not have a scanner or the ability to take pictures, and I am simply impressed that this all-in-one printer is basically the same size as the other printer I had. I have a small office and don't have a lot of space for a huge printer, and it's awesome that this one is small in size but powerful in its features and performance. 

Having used it for two weeks now, I am very content with this all-in-one printer. The color is a bright and beautiful white. The material is a hard plastic but you can feel the quality of the item. The speed in printing and scanning meets my expectations as it is more for a home-office printer. All in all, I am very happy with the features and the performance. MY FAVORITE PART is the App. This is the first printer that has an App that I can use to print documents or even pictures. Love that I can do that. It makes everything extremely easy and simple!",5 days ago
210,211,6478251,CDF3,5,Good printer that was easy to setup,"The HP Envy 7955e was easy to setup. The app walks your through the entire setup and the instructions were easy to understand and straightforward. To use the scanning feature it requires you to create an HP account. If you have one already, you would simply log in to your account. The scanning feature works, but it’s a bit slow. Would be nice if it was a bit faster scanning pages. The printer only has 2 cartridges. One for black ink and one that has 3 colors that are used to make colored pages all housed in on cartridge. The cartridges are fairly small, so I’m not sure how much printing I will get before having to replace them. I hope this one lasts because the last HP Printer I had stopped printing after several months, giving me ink cartridge error message even though I didn’t use it all that much. Hopefully, this one does not have those issues.",1 week ago
211,212,6478251,Mistabritt,4,HP Envy Inspire 7955e AIO Printer,"Received the HP Envy Inspire 7955e Wireless All-In-One Printer a few days ago and have been putting it through its paces. Upon opening this package, I noticed that HP took extra care with packing this printer up, by placing a box within a box to ensure it arrived safely and not all banged up.

After removing all of the plastic and cardboard, setup was a breeze. Simply plug up the printer and download the HP Smart app from the App Store for iOS devices or the Google Play Store for Android devices. Once downloaded, it took no time for the app to discover the printer and asked me if I wanted to add it to my Wi-Fi network. After that, the app pretty much guide you through the rest of the setup process which includes adding the ink cartridges and paper. During the setup process, I'm not sure what happened but I did have to turn the printer off and back on and close out the app completely are restart it. Seemed as though there was a hang-up on the setup process somewhere, but once rebooted everything kicked into gear and the setup process finished within 30 seconds. After aligning the printer heads and the initial test pages I started printing off some pictures from my iPhone. The pictures were crisp and clear. Color lines did not bleed like I've noticed with other printers that I've tested in the past; however colors did not appeared somewhat dull in some photos. Everything we copied and/or scanned over the last week has worked flawlessly without any issues thus far. HP also included some photo paper as well in the package.

This printer is a nice size and doesn't take up a lot of space on a desk or top of a small file cabinet. And this sandstone color is a nice change as well. HP really pushes the HP+ and Instant ink program through the app and has a tendency to bombard your email to signup. Although this printer is decent at printing photos, it may be better suited for documents and such. You can print documents/photos directly from your phone via the app or AirPrint if you have an iPhone. You can also download and install the HP software to your computer and print from there as well.",3 days ago
212,213,6478251,TechFan,4,"Good printer, with good options","This printer is almost an All-in-One minus the fax machine but its a pretty decent printer overall. I have a color laser printer and it needed ink and after realizing the staggering cost of replacing four laser cartridges, I decided it would be more cost effective to get a new printer for now. Coming from a laser printer, this one is noticeably slower, but it does the job. 

I had some difficulty setting this up on my windows desktop and I still havent been able to connect to my work laptop at all, but that could be due to security settings on my device. I initially tried setting this up through the HP Smart app and it wouldnt work. I eventually just went into the settings menu to add a printer and I was up and running in minimal time. Not sure if this was a problem with the operating system or the device, so I wont say anything negative about the printer in that regard. 

Once I set it up, I was prompted to sign up or add the device to my existing HP Smart account and in exchange I will receive 6 months of ink at no charge and a maximum of 700 pages per month. The HP Instant Ink program is a definite bonus as well. When connected to the internet, my ink levels are reported and i am automatically shipped the ink. The cost is much less than what i would pay in the stores and I dont have to run out and get it which is definitely a bonus. Im sure im not the only person who needed to print a lot of pages only to find out you had no ink. 

The app is very intuitive. I can print, scan, fax and copy using just my mobile device. I can also check my ink levels on all of my printers. So far this printer checks most of the boxes i need for use at home while teleworking or creating documents for my kids.",6 days ago
213,214,6426721,pauldar,5,Excellent Home/Office Printer – Built To Last,"There are lots of AIO printers out there to choose from in various price ranges. What is important is to buy an AIO that has all of the features you require, reliable, and built to last. I am impressed with this Epson WorkForce® Pro WF-4820 Wireless All-in-One because it is an excellent printer, especially for the volume of documents I produce out of my Home Office. And it does an outstanding job for my Grand Kids homework, Grandma's recipe cards, and produces topnotch work photos and family photographic treasures too. After four weeks of heavy use I believe this Epson is the best performing of all the printers I've owned in the past. This WF-4820 is marketed 'For Work', but it is the best in its class and price range for Home Office use and various kinds of printing activities for all my family members too. 

So, why do I think this is the best Home Office/Family printer you can purchase in its price class?

** PRINT QUALITY:

1. As a Construction Inspector I work as a Consultant for Architectural firms and Engineering Professionals. When I am out of town I often e-mail my daily construction notes and job photos that night to the Design Professionals for their evaluation the next morning. However, during various phases of the construction project I am required to submit printed and formalized documents indicating the job progress and adherence to the Architectural & Engineering Specifications Manual. I take great pride in submitting accurate, complete, and professional-caliber printed documents. The Epson WF-4820 uses 4800 x 2400 DPI, which is super-sharp for both documents and photos. I use the highest quality paper I can buy and expect my printer to produce the best resolution of printing to match my efforts. This Epson WF-4820 meets my expectations and is now my 'go-to' printer. WooHoo!

2. An interesting facet of construction inspections is photo documentation. Again when I am out of town I also forward JPEG photo files that night with my construction notes. On the other end they sometimes print out these photos using their high-volume, ink tank printer and present them directly to our clients. Two weeks ago one of the engineers called me and asked what kind of printer I was using to reproduce my 5” x 7” job photos. He was curious as to why my job photos were far superior to their high-volume, ink tank, printed photos from the same JPEG files. He said he noticed the difference when presenting the job photos to our clients. He was surprised when I told him I was using an inexpensive WF-4820 Epson AIO Ink Jet Printer. I explained to him that Epson Ink Jet Printers using PrecisionCore Heat Free Technology and DURABRITE Ultra instant-dry pigment inks are superior and produce professional-quality resolution photos compared to his high-volume, office, ink tank unit. I let him know that I can immediately touch my photos right out of the printer with no smudges or wash marks. I have printed out several job photos and the definition, color, and quality resolution is excellent. Family pics are terrific and impressive, and, can be printed in these sizes, 3-1/2” x 5”, 4” x 6”, 5” x 7” and 8” x 10” photos. Epson photo glossy photo paper is available at Best Buy.

** BUILD & DUTY CYCLE - This Epson WF-4820 AIO is built to perform and last for years. The printers, which I have previously bought for my Home Office lasted about one year before I wore them out. I print out approximately a thousand pages a month, which is the maximum for most AIO ink jet printers. This WF-4820 is built for a monthly duty cycle of 1,600 pages a month with a max of 33,000 pages if needed, but not recommended by Epson as routine. It is built for a higher volume then I use now and should last me for years. It weighs approximately 22.5 pounds and its footprint is approximately 17 inches x 17 inches, approximately 11 inches high, and approximately 20 inches deep. It fits easily into my Home Office on my desk and would in any home environment. The exterior housing is made of ABS plastic in a matte black, fingerprint-resistant finish and cleans easily. 

** SETUP – This is one of the easiest printer installations I've installed. I chose to use my home WI-FI router network, so I could print from other devices in my home network. WI-FI Direct is also available if I wish to limit the users ability to access my home network. This Epson can be directly connected to my router with an Ethernet cable for the most secure connection. It can also be connected directly to my desktop or laptop using a USB cable. And I could also use Bluetooth as long as I am in the same vicinity as my printer. The entire setup was accomplished using the LED front control panel, which walked me through the entire process, step by step. Connecting to my home WI-FI router was quick and easy. I have a MU-MIMO router and this Epson Printer takes advantage of MU MIMO, which allows multiple Wi-Fi devices to simultaneously receive multiple data streams. YooHoo! At the Epson Support website I downloaded the Epson WF-4820 Drivers & Utilities Combo Package, which sets up all the Printer, Scanner and Remote Print Drivers. The Utilities include the Software Updater, Scan, FAX, Printer Set-Up, and OCR Utility. Once my printer was connected to my home WI-FI system I could print and make changes to the printer from my laptop. A CD ROM is also furnished, which has all of the Drivers and Utilities to open and install on your desktop or laptop.

** LED CONTROL PANEL -The front facing, bright, generously-sized, 4.3 inch, Color Touchscreen, LED Control Panel is 90 degrees adjustable from vertical to upward horizontal for angle viewing making it so user-friendly. How cool is that? From this LED panel I can print, copy, fax, and scan. I can set the various sizes of paper, photos, card stock, and envelopes, and, change any settings. Easy to operate and I find it unnecessary to use the Owners' Manual, which is also available to download from the Epson Support website. One of my favorite settings on this LED panel is the password lock. I can keep my Grand Kids from using up all of my color cartridges – Grandpa Control. Love It.

** FEATURES - On top of this unit is the ADF (Automatic Document Feeder), which holds up to 35 pages. It is generously sized for feeding copies or scanning documents. Paper is fed from the right side of the ADF. The main paper tray holds up to 250 sheets of paper and has adjustable bottom and side arms for my choice of printing paper settings. Prints up to 25 pages per minute (ISO) in black and up to 12 pages per minute (ISO) in color. The paper tray is amply sized for my Home Office use. Maximum paper sheet size is 8 1/2 inches x 14 inches, and, there is 2MB of built-in memory. Duplex printing is a big plus. It saves paper, and is more professional then a report using only one-sided documents. This Epson printer is Energy Star compliant and will 'sleep' to save energy when not in use. There is a limited one year warranty.

** EPSON SMART PANEL APP - This app is FREE and can be downloaded from the Apple or Google Play Store for both iOS and Android. This App allows me to print documents or photos from my cell anywhere I am at in the US as long as my Epson printer is 'ON'. WoW! It also informs me of my printer status and ink cartridge levels. This App has many informative functions like Document Scanning from My Cell; Photo Printing; Printer Cleaning Functions; Video Help Manuals; and Trouble Shooting. 
 

** MAINTENANCE – Several times a year the scanner glass needs cleaning with a microfiber soft cloth moist with a quality glass cleaner. The rollers on the interior of the ADF need to be cleaned with a moist cloth also. The LED Control Panel will indicate the ink cartridge status and when they need to be replaced as well as the Maintenance Boxes. On the LED Touchscreen press 'Supply Status' – It will display when the Maintenance Box needs to be replaced as well as the level of ink in each cartridge.

I highly recommend the purchase of this outstanding Home/Office Epson printer. It will take me awhile to wear this unit out. For its price point, features, excellent document and photo printing this Epson WF-4820 is a bargain.",1 year ago
214,215,6426721,explore42,4,Perfect Fit for Our Home Office,"This Epson WF-4820 is a perfect fit for most small businesses or work at home offices. It provides the typical faxing, scanning, copying and printing capabilities that most people would need in a form factor that works for a small office. Compared to the laser printer we have the print image isn’t quite as sharp or have the same color depth but overall its fine for the typical day to day print and copy jobs. Our only gripe about the printer is that the exit tray is not well defined, has no stops at the end and is rather small. (see photo) 

Features: The printer can print 25 black or 12 color pages per minute which makes it one of the faster printers in this price range. It can print up to 4800x2400 dpi and it can do automatic double-sided printing. There is a document feeder that hold 35 pages for copying or scanning. It has a dedicated fax line so you can fax directly from the machine using a land line without having to use a fax relay service. The printer uses Epson’s instant dry ink which means the ink doesn’t smudge however the paper still has a slightly damp feeling if it has a lot of ink on the paper. To control the printer there is a 4.3 inch display with intuitive instructions on how to use the printer. There is only one paper tray that holds up to 250 pages so you can only have one size paper loaded at a time. The printer uses 4 cartridges for ink, one black and three color. This is nice because you can replace a single cartridge when it runs out. Although there is no SD card slots there is a USB port on the front of the printer so you can print directly from a USB flash drive using the control panel. 

Connectivity: We wanted a printer that could communicate via an ethernet cable as well as wireless and wireless-direct. Having wireless-direct we can let a visitor print directly to the printer without having to give them access to our wifi which is a good security feature. There is a short cut to activate wireless-direct right on the printer’s control panel home page. (see photo) The ethernet cable lets the wired computers print and the wireless feature lets us print from laptops, tablets and phones. So far we have been able to print from windows, ipads, android phones and chrome books with very little setup or issues. 

Epson Software: I was shocked to find a CD with software and the manual actually included with the printer. Normally you have to download all that from the manufacturer’s website so having the CD does save some time in set up for the devices that still have drives. The software does give you the opportunity to install some additional Epson utilities besides the minimum required but its easy to unclick those if you don’t want them. The mobile app for the Ipads and Android devices were easy to install and have worked problem free. The software allows you to check the ink levels of the printer and does automatic updates to the printer so everything is kept up to date. (see photo)

Final Thoughts: This printer is quick and it provides competitive print quality. The ability to scan, fax or copy on demand makes this an extremely attractive printer. The document feeder so far has worked issue free but it’s not built for large jobs. This is not a super tank type printer so if you are planning on printing a lot its best to get the XL cartridges vs the standard cartridges that come with the printer.",1 year ago
215,216,6426721,COAllum2013,4,Great Home/Small Business Everyday use printer,"This printer provides great quality prints. It is easy to use has great features such as a timed lock (if you have littles ones like I do that love to touch things they shouldn’t) it’s easy to install/setup. The computer software makes all functions easy to setup and compared to other brands of printers I prefer Epson just for that reason. The only thing to note is that the color print speed isn’t the greatest. If you need a quick color print for multiple pages, this may not print at the speed you’re looking for but just check the specs. Overall great printer. Giving it 4 out of 5 stars only because if print speed which is my fault for not looking into those details.",3 weeks ago
216,217,6426721,Tstall,4,Great Printer with Great Options,"Unboxing: Super easy as the printer comes in a bag with handles so you can easily remove this printer by yourself. I can't believe epson though of this (see pictures). You won't need someone to hold down the box as you take out the printer!

Wireless setup: (I only did this method) super quick and super easy. I never had a setup process that was this fast for a copier. All I did was scan a QR code on the screen and I was literally in business to print.

Size: The printer is pretty large I would say double the size of your typical home printer. Even though it is large I think its because of the options this printer has like large paper capacity, duplex printing, an ADF, etc.

Glass Copy (opening top): Coping in this method allows for a clear and crisp copy. Will quickly produce a color or black copy. 

ADF (automatic document feeder): quick and will produce similar results to a normal copy. A pro is that this thing can hold 35 pages which is not typical for a printer like this. Not a fully copiers size limit but more than 12 pages or less like a typical home copier/printer.

Print from computer: quick and does not take long for the printer to get your document and begin printing.

Print from mobile: quick and does not take long for the printer to get your document and begin printing. Loading on your phone is quick and automatically recognized my printer (after setup).

Paper Bin: hold half a ream (250 pages). Larger than typical but for the size of the machine I wish it held a full ream.

Ink installation: Seemed a little hard and it took me a couple of times to make sure I was putting in each cartridge correctly. The on screen directions were helpful but really didn't tell me how those cartridges should be put in without damaging the copier.

Touch Screen: Large, crisp and easy to read. It is very responsive! Almost to responsive as I noticed as my finger get close to the screen its already beeping to tell me that I select my option. This does not seem to be a problem as it always has selected what I wanted.

Interface: While basic it does have clear and crisp graphics. Looks completely professional and will be what you want when using a printer. 
Feels and looks like a top notch copier.

Other pros: Fast printer at 25 pages per min. in B&W and 12 pages per min. in color. Has double sided printing (my favorite feature).

Cons: Printer seems loud and is pretty strong when it prints. In other words the print shakes my table back and fourth because of how strong the print head prints. I don't mind it because it seems to be well built but I would expect the printer would not do this as of how high quality it is. (The table normally did not shake like this with other printers). 

Packaging con: Even though it was easy to remove their was a crazy amount of packaging tape. I had so much tape at the end that my table was full. I guess this could be a pro because epson really cares about the packaging of their copier.

I definitely recommend this printer as it is a work horse! I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to hold a whole ream of paper (because of how large the printer is it should be included).",1 year ago

The Epson Workforce Pro WF-1820 is an all in one printer that can handle all your small business or home office and even personal needs with ease. I have been using this printer now for a few days for my home office and personal need without any issues and the print jobs came out clean, clear and crisp. So, lets get into the details of what this printer has to offer.
Unboxing and Setup-
So, in the box is the printer, power cable, instruction manual, software cd and the startup toner cartridge. The printer has a USB cable option, but the USB CABLE IS NOT INCLUDED. If you prefer to use the printer with the USB cable you will have to purchase that separately. The setup of the printer was simple, all you have to do is follow the instruction on the 4.3 in touch screen display which will guide you through the setup process and WIFI setup. There was a firmware upgrade for the printer when I setup mine which took about 5 minutes but after that the printer was ready to go. 
App and features-
So, I setup the printer on my android device and my laptop. To use the printer on my android device you would need to install the “EPSON PRINT ENABLER” plug in and the “EPSON SMART PANEL” app to be able the scan, scan to email, and other print options and adjustments. On my laptop I was able to add the printer once I had the printer linked to my WIFI. 
Features:
Wireless- WIFI, Wired, USB, WIFI Direct 
Multifunction- Scan, Fax, Copy, Print and Scan to email option
Print Speed – Color 12 PPM / Black 25 PPM
Automatic Document Feeder
Photo Print (Amazing results on photo paper)

220,221,6426721,Chuck,4,"Nice printer with alot of functionality, but...","I've been using this printer for a few weeks and although I like it, I've experienced a few things that are a bit annoying. The printer provides plenty of functionality, and it's not too big, and even though it's a bit larger than my previous printer, it's still small enough for my small home office. Setup was simple, as was the installation of the software package. The touch-pad is much larger than my previous printer and so the icons are easier to read, making the operation of the UI much easier. Printed colors are vibrant and true to what you see on the screen, and for the most part, the printer does live up to the ppm estimates given in the documentation. However one thing I've experienced is when printing documents that are over 30 pages, sometimes a job will pause repeatedly for 5 secs or so during printing. This almost seems like a buffering problem, but I haven't had time to contact support.... it could be normal. I've also had multple times where the printer has warned that I'm out of paper even though the tray is practically full, and when I simply tap and select the same type of paper I'm printing with, the jobs starts, and completes, with no problem. I have no idea what's causing this, but again, I haven't had time to contact support. Both of these issues only occur occasionally, but it is annoying when they happen. For the most part, the printer works well and I'm happy with it.",1 year ago

223,224,6426721,Johnnyboy84,5,Home Office Necessity,"With the current state of affairs working from home has somewhat become the new norm. And as a result items like printers, laptops, web cameras & etc. have been flying off of store shelves. Not to mention online classes for a large majority of students is now a thing. 

But enough of that I suppose and let us get to the purpose of today's review and that is the Epson WF-4820. I am no stranger to printers I have used various brands but I find myself gravitating towards Epson because they make quality products. I currently own a Epson Eco tank printer which is great in its own way. 

:::General Thoughts:::

Who is this printer for? Well I'd say it is perfect for the home office, or even for the entire family to use especially given all that is going on. This printer is great is was packaged well and really easy to use and it does not take up too much space being that is tall rather than wide. I like that and i found the perfect spot for it on my desk.

I have spent two weeks with this printer and it has been a dream to use. It works as advertised and it does print really fast in comparison to my Epson EcoTank printer which is a little on the slow side. Whether printing from your phone or computer it will get the job done.

Unboxing the printer was the most time consuming process due to the great lengths that Epson had gone to package and protect the device in shipment. You just cut the box open and pull the plastic bag handles out. Be aware that this printer weighs a little less than 25lbs. So anyone with a bad back or who can not lift that much find an alternative way to pull the printer out or seek assistance. There is a bunch of tape all over so like any other printer take it all of and then set it up.

:::Setup:::

Thanks to the large 4.3 inch touchscreen I was able to setup my printer effortlessly to the network. It does support both bands of WiFi 2.4 & GHz which I was impressed with. That took a total of about 12 minutes. Power on the printer connected to the network and after that I connected my cellular phone with the Epson iPrint application for android which took less than a minute. And lastly my laptop which consisted of downloading drivers and adding the device to windows. altogether this probably took around 10 minutes and a test page was printed. Not too shabby honestly a quick and headache free setup.

:::Pro's & Con's:::

-Pro's-

1: Easy setup process
2: Large paper capacity
3: Can print photos & Envelopes & labels and auto detects paper sizes
4: All in one with great scanning & printing capabilities. I don't have a phone line so can't use the fax function.

-Con's-

1: Ink Cartridges (I am spoiled by the Epson EcoTank printer)

Once you have used an all in one printer you generally know what to expect it is more or less the same the printer prints various ways via USB, WiFi or Ethernet. The scanning capabilities function more or less like every other device you can save to the computer and or email and share documents with others.

I want to further expand on why I consider going back to ink cartridges as a con. I Have an Epson EcoTank printer and it does not have ink cartridges but rather ink bottles where you buy large capacity bottles of ink instead and it is a better technology in my eyes and it provides slightly more value. While the EcoTank is not perfect because in my experience it isn't as fast to print as this printer but no device is perfect. My other printer lacks the large touchscreen and a few other features found on the WF 4820. 

In closing the WF 4820 is a great device on it's own. I love the fact that it works well with my Samsung Note 10, and Windows 10 devices. I do not have apple products to test this on so I can not speak about that. This printer does as advertised and works as it should out of the box with minimal effort on my behalf.

:::TL:DR:::

The Epson WF 4820 would make a great addition to any home or small office. It is affordable, user friendly, and a jack of all trades printer. I have two Epson printers and each has their individual strengths but I do love this printer a little more due to the touchscreen and ease of use.If you need a fast and easy printer consider the Epson WF 4820.",9 months ago
224,225,6426721,Njmomof3,5,ABSOLUTE GEM for the home office,"The Epson WorkForce Pro WF-4820 was exactly the easy install I needed for my home office. It was easy to unbox, setup, and get the wifi connected --- this is a non-negotiable feature for me as my entire home basically runs on wifi. Additionally, the touchscreen screen is rather large for a printer and was so easy to navigate through. I have noticed that printers with all of these features that this one has --- scanning, copying, faxing, autoduplex, sharp color printing, USB connection, wifi connectivity makes it so easy to print from anywhere on the same wifi connection (so I can print from anywhere in my home, EVEN FROM MY SMARTPHONE) makes this an easy call and straight shot. 
My only con was that the paper tray was a bit troublesome to get in and out at first, but it eventually worked. Otherwise, this printer is simply a STEAL for the price.",1 year ago
225,226,6426721,Apoc,1,Hardware Failure & Disappointing Print Quality,"We were excited about this purchase, as it was going to save a little space in our home office. Sadly it has been little more than disappointing! Hardware failure results in pages snagging within the document feeder. We are greeted with error messages at every attempt to use the document feeder. The result is time consuming manual scanning of individual documents, and creation of titles for each individual page. As importantly, the print quality did not meet our expectations. When compared to a competitor model, this printer was purchased to replace. Each of similar cost & capabilities. The Epson prints are grainy, and somewhat ""gray"" in appearance. Blacks are not crisp, other colors are muted. Prints almost look faded. Rendering the printer useless for printing photos, even on the best photo paper. This is our first Epson printer purchase. It will likely be the last. Not worth the effort to try, and resolve this with Epson warranty services... I've been on hold for over 20 minutes. Customer service was difficult to communicate with, and rather impolite. Overall just disappointing!",1 year ago
226,227,6426721,GirlsCanTechToo,3,"Robust printer for home, maybe not the office","The Epson WorkForce 4820 is marketed as a business-suited printer. That might be pushing it a little, unless it is being used by an office of 5 people, or one employee's dedicated printer. This might be a more suitable home printer for families who print a lot, or individuals working from home that need a printer for their job.

QUICK SUMMARY
PROS:
- Fast printing, and automatic duplex printing
- Print quality is excellent - even does well for photos.
- Has a quiet mode that is actually quiet.
- Large touchscreen that is VERY sensitive and therefore responds well.
- Intuitive interface makes operating from the touchscreen easy.
- Can scan a large number of pages in a single scan job.
- SmartScan application has a lot of features, including a preview option that lets you make some modifications before saving the document. Can also scan to various cloud services via the computer and mobile.
- Setup is easy, in part because you don't get to make a lot of choices.

CONS:
- Initial setup involved several steps that just froze.
- Lacks duplex scanning.
- A bit bulky.
- Slow to initiate a print job if in sleep mode.
- If paper type set in printer properties does not match the paper type set at the printer, it requires interaction with the printer via the touchscreen (making it bad for office environments where multiple people may share the printer and use different paper types).
- Getting the scanning function to work with my computer took technical expertise.

SETUP
Setup of the WF-4820 was actually simple and rather quick. It took me about 20 minutes to unpack, remove all of the tape, load cartridges, and get through most of the installation. I used the enclosed CD (I have a drive connected to my computer via USB), and the setup software actually downloaded the drivers and printer software from the internet (meaning you will need a connection to install it). The setup requires little interaction, but also means it installs everything whether you want it or not. I don't need the faxing feature, but oh well. It gives the ability to try to connect the device to your network without having to put in the network password, but this did not work for me (probably because I have uPNP disabled on my router). Therefore, I had to connect the printer to the network from the device's touchscreen. At the end of the installation, it recommended I take the firmware upgrade that was available, which I did. The printer completed the upgrade and rebooted, but the software did not recognize it, and I could not close out of it without involving task manager.

Later, I had to turn the printer off, and it froze in the ""shutdown"" process. It had a spinning wheel on the display for over 2 minutes, and I finally had to unplug it to get it to turn off. It's not cold where I live. What's with all the freezing???

PRINTING
This printer is fast when it comes to normal printing. I was easily able to print a two-sided document in under 10 seconds (yes this printer can print on both sides automatically). It also has a 250-sheet paper tray, so unlike a lot of small home inkjet printers, you won't have to reload the paper tray constantly. I printed documents from my Windows computer and using the Epson iPrint app on my iPhone, and both printed quickly. It used in a high-volume printing environment, this printer will definitely meet the demand.

Print quality is excellent. Text is crisp with no ""fuzz"" around the edge of the letters, basic pictures, graphs, etc, look clean. This is not a photo printer, but I gave it a try anyway and printed 4 pictures on photo paper. I made sure to use the best settings for this (tell the printer that it was loaded with glossy photo paper, use high settings in the properties, etc). The photos actually looked fantastic! The colors were bold (not washed out) and mostly accurate (teal colors seemed to favor blue). While this is not a photo printer, you could use it as a family's main printer to print schoolwork, office work, and pictures without sacrificing quality.

PREFIX TO SCANNING
I will prefix the next few paragraphs by stating that I am not a fan of most manufacturer's printing/scanning software. It is easily intimidating for many users, as the error messages that display when something doesn't work properly are either extremely vague, very technical, or just don't actually explain what the problem is. Even worse is the support that goes with these errors, as it is limited and often gives solutions that don't apply or are not applicable to your problem.

SCANNING ISSUES
Scanning was another matter, and this is where this device presented some problems. After completing the setup of the printer, I tested out the mobile app almost immediately, and scanning was relatively simple. The only hiccup I ran into is the scanner does not sense the location of the scan - you must go into the settings under the scan function and tell it whether you are scanning from the ADF (automatic document feeder) or the glass. I have used scanners in another popular brands that automatically check for this - first it checks the ADF, and if it senses there is no document, it assumes the glass. Several times in testing this feature, I forgot to change the document source first and either got an error (no document in ADF), or got a blank scan (nothing on glass).

Scanning from my Windows computer presented problems almost immediately. Scanning is performed using the Epson ScanSmart application. I pressed ""Scan"" and immediately got an error stating that the scanner was in use by another computer and to wait until it finished, and then gave me the IP address of the device (which was the computer from which I was trying to initiate the scan). It was followed by another error that set that SmartScan was unable to communicate with the scanner. Then I tried to scan directly from the scanner to my computer using the device's touchscreen, and that same error popped up on my computer, and about 20 seconds later, the device dinged with an on-screen message saying it could not communicate with the printer.

Researching this problem online yielded few answers. Of course, if you are not technical, or don't happen to know what device corospondes to the IP address the error is providing, it's of little use and adds to the confusion (see my prefix above) Even Epson's ""Support"" would only take me to the device's download page, but did not have any support articles at all, let alone specific to this issue.

I finally found an article online with a suggestion to add the device in the Epson Scanner Settings application, which has to be done by IP address. Knowing that the WF-4820 was currently connected by Wi-Fi to my network via DHCP, I decided that for this solution to work, it would be best if the device had a static IP. I rarely set a static IP on a device, but rather set a reservation in my router for the device by MAC address. Weirdly, after I set the IP reservation and rebooted the printer, the SmartScan application started working! I never had to make changes in the Scan Settings program.

If you are reading this and do not understand what I explained in the previous paragraph, you would be stuck at this point and unable to scan to your computer. And Epson's website won't be of much help.

CONCLUSION
Overall, this is great ""workhorse"" printer for home, or perhaps very small office environments, or a fantastic option for a single employee's desk. It will meet the demands that many smaller inkjets just won't, between speed, capacity, and features. If you are lucky enough to have a clean install process and none of the issues I had, this will be a quick and easy process to add this printer to your environment. If you are not so lucky, it will be helpful to have someone around (if not yourself) that is comfortable with troubleshooting technical issues. I personally would really like to see Epson do more to assist it's users when things go wrong, because they always do.",10 months ago

228,229,6426721,Mikcin,4,Good printer for the price,This is a replacement for a previous epson. Why? Because I do not print color that often and the print head dried up except for black and it was cheaper to buy this one than repair my existing printer.

230,231,6426721,iconoclast,5,Fast and Quiet All-in-One Printer,"The Epson WF-4820 all-in-one printer works well in a small office or home office. It packs a lot of features into a small footprint. The WF-4820 can print, copy, scan and fax. I am a Graphic Designer and printed a logo full-size both in black & white and in color. The black & white print was sharp and rich, without lines or spots. The color print was rendered perfectly, also sharp and in true colors. I used the Copy and Scan functions on a spiral-bound sketchbook with a colored composition book pattern. The copy was sharp and accurate both in black & white and in color. The scan was even sharper, and I easily created the scan file as a .PDF directly onto a USB stick. One feature that surprised me is that the scanner lid has a floating hinge. This allows you to place a thick document or book on the scanner, and the lid adjusts. 

Unpacking was easy. The packing is well-designed, with the printer packed in a rugged plastic bag. Use the bag handles to lift the printer straight out of the box. Setup takes a few minutes to remove the many tape strips that protect the printer during shipment. Insert the included CMYK cartridges and wait for the printer to prime the ink. Then let the printer screen to guide you through the wireless setup. If you prefer, you can use an Ethernet or USB connection to your network or computer (cables not included).

Pros:
- Fast printing in both black & white and color
- Large capacity paper tray holds 250 sheets
- Can print on various paper types and thicknesses
- Floating hinge on scanner lid accommodates thick documents and books
- Easy to set up
- WiFi, Ethernet and USB connectivity
- Small footprint
- Printer drivers available on included DVD and also free to download off the Epson Web site
- Four (CMYK) ink cartridge slots clearly marked inside printer
- Scan to USB drive, computer, or network storage device.
- FAX mode available for those with land lines.
- Large, bright screen and intuitive controls.

Cons:
- No USB or Ethernet cables included
- No cons re: features/functions

233,234,6404824,ryanmcv,4,Excellent Choice for Home Printing,"I haven't owned a printer for a few years since I've always been turned off by the high costs of ink cartridges and the clunky designs and performance of older printers. The HP ENVY 6455e shows just how far printer technology has come in just a few years. It has a sleek, minimalist design and does everything I need as a home user (with occasional work-from-home needs). I was skeptical of the HP+ and Instant Ink programs, but it seems like this setup will actually save me money in the long run.

=== SETUP ===
- The Envy 6455e has a pretty small footprint and fits nicely on a desk or shelf. The printer has a USB port if you prefer a wired connection to your computer, but a USB cable is not included with the printer. The preferred setup method is via wireless connection through the HP Smart app for iOS or Android.
- I set up the printer through the HP Smart app and it could not have been easier. The printer connected to my Wi-Fi network without issue and was up and running in less than 10 minutes.
- My Windows 10 computers recognized the printer instantly and automatically installed the HP Smart app. No configuration required.
- Some of the advanced settings for the printer (such as networking, Bluetooth, etc.) are burried deep within the HP Smart app, and you will need the PIN that is on a sticker on the inside of the printer to access some of these settings.
- Unfortunately, you can't adjust any settings using the buttons on the printer itself -- everything is done via the HP Smart app (including adjustments to the LED light on the front of the printer).

=== PRINTING ===
- Printing quality is very good for an inkjet printer. I'm sure there are better options out there if you need professional quality photo and graphic printing, but for standard home use, it's great. I noticed zero alignment problems and no distortion in printed text or images.
- The printer supports duplex (double-sided) printing, which I was surprised to see in such a small machine.
- The paper tray only holds about 100 pages, so you might find yourself adding paper frequently if you print more than a few pages a day.
- Only letter-sized (8.5x11) paper is supported, but you can print many sizes of envelopes (up to #10 size).
- Printing speed is pretty quick, but this is not designed for high-volume printing. Noise levels are about what you'd expect from an inkjet while printing -- not quiet, but not loud either.
- The ink cartridges seem very small (at least the included ones). My guess is that they will only last about 100-200 pages before needing to be changed. Hopefully the ones sent via the HP+ Instant Ink program will be larger.

=== SCANNING ==
- Like everything else, the scanner is perfectly adequate for home use. I've scanned several black-and-white documents while working from home as well as some old photos. Everything I've scanned looks great with no distortion. Colors in scanned photos/documents seem pretty accurate if not a bit washed out.
- I prefer to scan using the HP Smart app on Windows, which allows you to easily edit and crop scans before saving them to PDF or JPG.
- The scanner supports up to 1200 dpi, which is good for a small home printer.
- The auto feeder on top of the printer works great for scanning multi-page documents. It supports up to 35 pages and surprisingly scans pages pretty quickly.

=== HP+ / INSTANT INK ===
- I'll admit I was skeptical about this program, since it seems at first to just be another subscription to keep track of. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that the instant ink plans are actually very affordable with options for light and heavy users. For as little as 99 cents a month, you can make sure you never run out of ink or have to worry about buying expensive cartridges.
- The downside to signing up for HP+ is that you have to keep your printer connected to the Internet, and you can only use genuine HP ink cartridges going forward. That means if you cancel the instant ink subscription (which you can do at any time), you can't buy cheaper knock-off brands or refill old cartridges. Given the small cost of the instant ink subscription, I'd say it's worth the trade off.
- Signing up for HP+ also unlocks the full features of the HP Smart app, allowing you to initiate print jobs from anywhere and send ""mobile faxes.""
- I don't usually recommend signing up for something that requires an ""always on"" Internet connection or locks you into using one brand's accessories. But for something like a printer -- where I just want to set it up and forget about it -- I don't mind it.

== OVERALL ===
Is this the most fully-featured printer on the market? Not by a long stretch, but that's perfectly fine. This is more than enough for most small households. I wish the printer weren't so dependent on the HP Smart app -- they could have easily included a screen allowing you to adjust some basic settings directly on the printer. But this seems to be the direction the market is moving for home printers. Luckily, the app works great on mobile and Windows, and I have very few complaints about the performance of the printer itself. Home office or other users with large print jobs should look elsewhere, but for everyone else, this one deserves a look.",7 months ago
234,235,6404824,stoptheclocks,3,Well Rounded Printer for Home/Office,"The HP Envy Pro 6455 Wireless All In One (AIO) Inkjet Printer is great for home office productivity. You can even get Ink sent to your house automatically if you wish. Here are the features:

• Setup/App
Unfortunately this was the hard part for me. I downloaded the HP app and tried to setup the printer from HP easy setup. I couldn’t get the HP printer to setup wirelessly. I tried the networks and passwords and never came up with a match. I made sure that the HP printer was matched with the Smart phone HP app on the same network. I kept getting a message that I needed to update firmware and a missing driver. It was no small task to get these 2 things working with the HP printer. After a lot of trial and error, I was finally to setup the HP Envy Pro 6455 with a USB Type B to USB Type A cable (not included). I was happy just to be connected now. The other ways you can connect are through Dual Band WiFi, Bluetooth and USB (that is what I did). 
• Printing
Printing was easy and less time consuming than the setup. The printed paper came out beautiful and sharp. The inkjet printers are known for their speed and clarity in printing. The HP Envy Pro 6455 was no different. I copied and pasted different bits of notes to a Word document. I had no issues or troubles at all. The HP printer even has an auto two sided printing feature to save on paper.
• Ink Cartridges 
HP ink No. 67 black and No. 67 color are the ink cartridges that were supplied. I had to lift up the flatbed scanner and underneath for the ink to be installed. This was a very simple task of peeling off of tape and inserting the ink cartridge longer end first. There is a black top for black ink and purple top for color ink. Make sure your printer in on! ISO (International Standards Organization) rates the color per minute at 7 pages and in black at 10 pages. These speeds help you stay on task with your printing projects.
• Copy/Scan
After printing a test page, the HP printer told me to scan it. So I placed the print page (Printside down) on the scanner. It worked quickly and printed out the test page for aligning and ink saturation. Copying pages was a breeze as from printing several pages to scanning to copy a page. No problem or issues there. The flatbed scanner resolution is up to 1200 x 1200 dpi while the color resolution is up to 4800 x 4800 dpi. I scanned in a color picture and printed it off on glossy paper. It turned out really well. I have included the pics in my photos. Another feauture which is very helpful is borderless printing. There is no need to cut off the edges if there is not any!
• Auto Document Paper Feeder
At the bottom of the HP printer is located a paper tray. Slide out the tray to add 100 pages of paper to the printer. You can also add paper to the top of the HP printer. Place the paper in the upper tray and it will go through the paper feeder to be printed on.
• Control Panel
There are several ways to run the HP printer from the control panel. There are 7 icons that guide you to do what you want with the printer. The symbols are: Information, Cancel, Resume, Copy, Power, Wireless Setup and ADF Error. There are instructions on how to use the control panel in the manual on the HP website. 

Overall this is a great HP printer for copying, scanning, printing, the HP app and high capacity paper tray. The pages print fast in color or B&W. I am overall happy with the HP ENVY Pro 6455 AIO printer, but disappointed I couldn’t get the app to run.",1 year ago

This printer is replacing my aging HP PhotoSmart 7520. It was hands down the best printer ever made. HP Envy Pro 6455 is a good solid printer for everyday printing and a piece of technology that doesn't have to look like a sore thumb in the study room.",1 year ago
236,237,6404824,BenisJ,3,A minimalist approach to robust features,"You'd be hard pressed to buy a brand new home inkjet printer in this day and age that does not produce the quality output. The HP Envy 6455e is no exception: It produces high, inkjet quality prints. Consequently, your decision should probably be driven by *features* and *price*.

When selecting this printer, I was looking outside of my normal ""home office"" criteria as this printer ultimately is not for me. It will be handed down to my college student this fall as a basic, fallback printing/scanning option should he need it in his apartment. Thus, my criteria was ""inexpensive, entry-level printer with decent ink prices with a very low (anticipated) duty cycle."" 

***Features: ""Minimally robust.""

If I am being 100% honest, HP's approach is not for me. I have worked in IT for over 25 years and have literally serviced, purchased and installed hundreds of printers. I have seen installation processes change, quality improve, features enhanced...but I feel like HP took a step backwards with their ""minimalist"" approach to printer interaction.

I do not like the lack of an LED display screen on this printer. Nor do I like that I cannot see what the 6 icons (oh wait, there is a 7th icon if you count the digital number display) are at all times. Nor can you touch them unless they want to be touched (i.e. if you put an object on the glass, the copy icon will light up). Call me old-fashioned, but I don't want to be forced to use my phone or laptop to configure my printer/scanner/copier actions when I am standing at the device. For example: If I want to scan a document to Google Drive from the printer, I want a touchscreen ON THE PRINTER that gives me that option--I don't want to have to pull out my phone and ""beam"" the instructions to the printer.

That being said, there are a LOT of features available through the app--an app can be installed on Windows, iOS and Android devices with relative ease via the 123.hp.com website or your app store. One potentially useful feature...that I have not yet mastered...is the ""hold your print job"" service (Private Pickup). I can see value in a feature where you can send a job to the printer but not have it print until you are standing at the device. At the same time, I question if you really need that functionality on a ""home"" printer. Private printing is more of a business service. [Full disclosure: I tried Private Printing a Google Photos image from my phone multiple times and failed each time. Probably my fault, but maybe not. I quit exploring the feature after 4 fails.]

***Price: ""Average price for an entry-level printer.""

The price of this AIO is reasonable. 

Price per print is average if you are buying OEM ink at retail prices. At $30 for the black+color package with estimated 120pg yield black and 100pg yield color you should spend around 25¢/pg ($30/120pages) mixed content. To be fair, though, assessing a ""per page"" price to home printing is a crap shoot.

With the HP+ Instant Ink service, the price per page game changes and gets confusing. The HP+ Instant Ink service is NOT something I plan on keeping after the trial period because I just don't think the printer will get that much use in our household. Nonetheless, I signed up for the service without much of an idea of what I was doing. 

I picked the 99¢ plan based on how little we print. I guess that means that if I print ~12 pages per month I will run out of ink in ~10 months. I will have spent $10 on my ink subscription. They will ship the ink to me and I saved essentially $20 over the $30 black+color bundle ""off the shelf"" price? Seems like a bargain, until maybe it is not on months where I go over? I don't understand the overage fees. I did see that I can ""rollover"" up to 45 pages of overage in my plan but again, seems confusing. I must be getting old.

***Overall Experience: ""The HP Envy 6455e is an AIO printer that performs adequately but is a bit sluggish.""

From the moment I broke the tape seal on the box to the moment I printed my first document from my laptop took about 20 minutes. Initially, I was confused by the lack of buttons and displays on the printer but once I realized everything about this printer starts with an app (accessible via 123.hp.com) I was able to connect the printer to wifi via the app seamlessly. Should you not have instructions handy, the printer will generate them for you once you have paper and ink loaded. Nonetheless, the app is an evil necessity of this printer...which again, is a foreign and frustrating concept to me. [Note: My instruction printout was poorly aligned. During the initial setup process the printer generates a ""test pattern"" that you place on the glass to clean up alignment issues via voodoo, lasers and magic. In my second image you can see that output following the alignment is fine.]

Regardless, 20 minutes after unboxing I could print from my phone or laptop.

As for the things I cannot stand aside from having to control everything via an app because HP didn't include an on-device display/control screen? The printer has ""ground effect"" lights that I have not figure out how to turn off. This printer is constantly glowing which I find annoying. It also ""plays sounds"" when jobs finish which is totally unnecessary.

***Pros:
- Small footprint
- Quiet
- Mobile printing
- ADF (auto document feeder--for scanning/copying)
- Duplex printing
- Dual band wifi
- Up to 1200dpi scanning (but only 300dpi copying)
- Scan to cloud/email (via app--again, no LED screen on printer to scan direct to cloud/email from the printer)
- ""Self-healing wifi"" (not sure what that means, but I assume it just means it stores settings to reconnect to wifi/devices if they go offline)

***Cons:
- Holds about 5 sheets of paper in the paper tray. (Not really, but the paper tray is only about .5"" deep and HP claims up to 100 sheets of paper but I question that number) 
- Maxes out at 9 copies per session
- Doesn't support ""oversized"" papers but accepts letter, A4, 4x6, 5x7, 8x10 and #10 envelopes
- Constantly illuminated (as shown in other review posts)
- Tri-color ink cartridge means you are undoubtedly throwing out excess of the other two colors when one color runs out
- No on-printer display screen

Notes:
- Manual duplex scanning
- Enlarge and reduce options
- Not the fastest inkjet printer I have used, but adequate for home/infrequent printing
- White devices usually turn yellow over time

If you don't mind using an app to do anything beyond simple printing, this inkjet is as good as any--especially if you prefer a subscription ink service over buying your own. Given the HP Instant Ink is essentially a ""flat rate"" plan (they don't appear to separate color ink from black ink in their subscription plan) I can see benefits especially if you do a lot of color printing.

If the idea of an ink subscription service annoys you...or the idea of having to use an app to control the features of your printer annoys you...then consider looking elsewhere.",7 months ago

It is fairly quite and smooth printing and scanning. HP honestly did great on that. The Envy Pro 6455 has minimalist interface which honestly not really appreciated (by me at least) I like when they have the comprehensive LCD for more access and stand alone functionalities. This printer would require the use of a smart phone device to do the job properly.
Scanner glass is well placed. Scanning paper feeder is working nice. in the 2 days usage, I never had a jam. It seems to do the job properly. I had the printer installed in a farther corner of the office (reasonably away from wifi router) and it was able to connect without issues.
Phone app interface is really easy to use and working fairly fine. I have all the HP printers linked and I can monitor them all. It even alerts about low paper before you run out.
Back to Instant Ink, HP is offering the starting program for about $3 a month for 50 pages with unused rollover up to 100 pages. After that you pay about $1 per 10 pages when you go over. All that while offering high (HP original) Ink and after sale support in case the cartridge have issues (it happened once in the 3 years).

HP offers free 24 months of mobile fax with this Envy Pro 6455. It might be something some people like to have. I tried to mess around it and it looks like you can only send faxes but can't receive. It would definitely be more useful if it works both ways. Any way, it is a service that you might need one day. Some institutes still use fax only to send documents...

I would recommend this for daily usage. Good for printing small to average quantity of pages daily. Good and fast WiFi link connection. Fast scanning to computer and relatively quite printing.
Fashionable lights and minimalist control (LCD would be better).",1 year ago

I must say my  HP Envy Pro 6455 is the best purchase I’ve mad so far. I also love the fact that it's wireless and have an HP ink program that let's me know when I need to order more ink and I get it delivered right to my front door.",1 month ago
239,240,6404824,vortex0007,4,Like the box says... great for everyday printing.,"The hardest part about the unboxing and setup of the the HP Envy 6455e All-in-One printer is getting the ink cartridges added. I’m use to the HP OfficeJet Pro lineup which use a long thin ink cartridge, usually one cartridge per color, instead of the Envy’s two short fat cartridges. On the ink cartridge holder, there’s a plastic flap that you lift while you awkwardly angle and push in the two cartridges until they kind of snap into place, at which point the plastic lid slides down creating a type of cradle to keep them in place. If you can get this part correct, the rest of the product is a breeze to setup.

The Envy is the first printer I’ve had in twenty-five years that does not come with a display screen. The Envy uses a smart control panel where buttons appear only when needed. This technology didn’t work all that well during the initial setup process, specifically during the printer alignment step. During this phase of setup a page is printed then needs to be scanned. Pressing the scan button that lit up did nothing. Eventually the printer hit some type of internal timeout and the button flashed a couple of times, I pressed the scan button a couple more times and eventually the printer figured out how to scan the document and complete the alignment setup process. Post setup, a firmware update was installed and no similar problems have occurred so make sure you get that firmware update installed.

Adobe released the 2020 Coloring Book the day before the printer arrived so I downloaded this 72-page 800MB PDF from Adobe: https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/discover/article/adobe-coloring-book-2020. Printing this thing two-sided on HP’s premium photo paper would be a great test case for the Envy. 

I started by trying to print a single page from the Coloring Book and the result was an 8.5 X 11 full page of solid black ink. It was not what I was hoping for, but this accident illustrated that the Envy is not all that great when it comes to large solid black prints, as the printer suffers from banding see Image number 1 included.

Image number 2 of a three-eyed woman was printed on an HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M479fdw using the same paper used with the Envy. Notice the black sky is solid black with no banding. Looking at the same image printed with the Envy in image number 3, the banding presents heavily in the sky, but the remainder of the document looks crisp. 

Image number 4 of the mermaids is the LaserJet, Image number 5 is the Envy. They are almost identical and the Envy does great with small patches of black. The bottom line here is that the Envy is great for everyday printing, but is not a printer I would turn to if you plan to print photos.

Note that the images you are seeing here were printed, then scanned using the Envy’s automatic document feeder and the HP Smart App for macOS with the default resolution of 300dpi

Print quality aside, the double-sided printing feature had the 72 page coloring book printed in around 15 minutes. Approximately 4 minutes of that total time was the printer giving the ink about 6-8 seconds to dry before pulling the page back over to flip on the other side. It’s not the fastest printer around but I’ll take quality of printing over speed any day of the week. 

Without an LCD to display warning and errors, the printer comes with a speaker that emits all kinds of musical chimes to alert you to activity including inserting or removing paper into the 35-page automatic document feeder (ADF). The ADF is not particularly fast or slow but worked well and the speaker emits loud enough sounds to get my attention when necessary. 

The last area I’ll comment on is HP Plus. HP’s subscription service to assist with automatic ink cartridges when necessary. The day after printing the 72-page coloring book, the single black page, and nothing else, I opened up the HP Smart App (version 12.6.2 (552) from my macOS and the app displayed a warning that the ink levels are low. Closing the app, rebooting the macOS and then re-opening the HP Smart app results in no warning sign about the ink levels, but Image 5 shows you the current estimated ink levels. I’m feeling ignorant as I’m not sure why printing 73 pages of black results in the color ink cartridges being used at all, but it will be interesting to see when this printer actually triggers a new cartridge to be ordered. If you do sign up for HP Plus, HP indicates that the ink cartridges you receive will include MORE ink than what you get by going to a retailer, and I hope more ink than what comes in the box as the starter set of ink.",7 months ago
240,241,6404824,PhillipB,5,Great simple multifunction printer.,"Easy to use. Easy to setup. 

This multifunction printer is great for home use. 

Ink install was easy. Just follow the program steps and you are set.

Setup on Android Pixel 3XL was a snap. Setup on my kids chrome books was easy.

The 6 months of HP+ required me to enter my payment info. Ok. Was not too fond of that but at least it will cover me for 6 months. Fyi I have another printer enrolled in HP+ and they just sent me ink for that other printer. I did not have to do anything. Pretty nice. And it was within my 6 months so it was free. Nice.

HP did finally hear my complaint which was to fix their software bugs. I just got an update on Android and it looks like the interface is much better and remembers my phone or kids chromebook when updates occur and does not make it a pain to look for the printer again and again. So thanks HP.

The printer itself is sleek. It has a nice LED light and has a modern look.

Print quality it decent for an ink jet. Based on size of inkjet cartridges you will go through ink cartridge pretty fast so be aware of this as part of your consideration.

Based on what I have seen, I would recommend this product for simple home use. Hope HP keeps up with their software interface.

Only con was that my first print out the paper jammed. It might have been operator error. After I cleared it I printed out several other items and no jam.",7 months ago

However, after playing with the Envy 6455 Pro I find it quite charming. The app download for my phone as well as the installation of the driver app on my computer were both quick and easy. The scan to feature HP offers is top of the line and for a free device it rivals other top paid editors that are available. The print quality is perfect with crisp coloring and sharp detail. I will say this unit prints slower than its predecessor the 5500 but again it does print much cleaner. Long short, this is a great little printer, but I think this is a great little printer for the ""Right"" user. If you are looking to print volumes and volumes of pages, then I might suggest the 9000 series. I think this one would be great for a student or occasional use printer. The one thing that is what I referred to as the “Charming” aspect, is the general ambiance it the unit provides. I was wowed by the ambient lighting and cute little chimes of this envy and this is what makes me envision it in a dorm room or kitchen desk. They also removed the touch screens that have become common place and opted for simplicity. I know this is a bit retro in thought, but I think the touch screens tend to be too small and hard to navigate. Again, I have several printers laying around but for our home and the quantity of printing needs we actually have I made this jewel our everyday go to. In addition, I found another novel showcase on the Windows 10 app Play & Learn that takes you to HP’s website and has a wonderful selection of things you can print. From learning resources to cool builds like the home-made planetarium we are working on now. I am a fan of this unit and it this one fits your print needs, I highly recommend.",1 year ago

245,246,6404824,TheHipsterTechie,1,Missed the Mark,"The digital renaissance spurred by digital cameras in the early 2000's created the D.I.Y home printing phenomena. As cameras became more advance, printers and ink continued to be expensive. So much that cartridges continue to be a home office manager's budget nightmare. Honestly, I was reluctant at first in obtaining a new printer since the expense cost associated with cartridge printers continue to baffle me. Enter the HP Smart program with Insta Ink, an innovative experiment to keep customers from buying new printers and to share the printing costs through a membership program that allows for the manufacture to know your printing needs thru real time automation. While noble, there are opportunities with HP ENVY 6455. I am going to focus this review on my experience in printing photos only. 

My first impression when taking it out of the box was favorable. The printer is not too tall and bulky as most scanner printers in the market. This is a low profile scanner.
I utilized there HP Smart app, both thru my new Dell laptop and also thru two different smart phones (android and iPhone), and photo paper. I must say that was the easiest app to setup and use. The quality of print output thru my wife's Samsung phone was surprising better than from my laptop, however, her phone did not offer a photo size in the menu options menu, this is a key opportunity for HP's smart app developer's. When printing from my laptop, I was able to choose the size of my photo size print. However, the results from printing from my laptop was disappointing. There were subtle vertical cartridge streaks. Is there a thing? I’ll include an image from an upload of what I mean by vertical lines. That brings me to the only positive thing on this ENVY 6455. The scanner works. It facilitated the opportunity to share with you the vertical streaks. Wow! Not happy with the printing results, but the scanning was amazing. You’ll get to see my disappointment on the poor photo quality. 

I bought in to the digital renaissance in hopes to be more efficient with my hard copy output in photo printing, however new printers such as ENVY 6455 are built on old cartridge engineering. I get that HP is wanting to gain a foothold with their automation service model, however, that comes at the consumer cost by surrendering more of our privacy and wallet upfront for convenience. Not sure if I’d like to return for seconds when I did not obtain satisfactory printing results in the first place from ENVY 6455. It does beg the question, why have printers continue to be the most replaceable hardware in computer peripherals? I believe now is the best time for consumers to ask for a better printing experience through a complete relook on quality output and not get suckered into a monthly fee service for ink. It’s twenty years in the making. Let the new renaissance begin.",1 year ago

Summary:
An adequate inkjet printer with reliable quality and speed.

Pros:
* Price. Not an expensive printer if you factor in the 6 months of InstantInk. The more you print the more value.
* Form Factor. An appropriately sized printer for its functions.
* Connectivity. There are various methods to send print jobs to this printer. Bluetooth, AirPrint, and via the networked device.
* Mobile App. The mobile app helps you do some frequent things. It is handy, not sure it's necessary, but it is handy. It is a bit wonky in navigating to different pages. In some cases, though, it doesn't know it is open and forces you to log out or close and re-open the app.

Cons:
* Quality. Print quality isn't great for images. Even on glossy paper. You can very clearly see banding. I tried a few types of paper. 
* No LCD. I didn't think this was going to be a problem. But it is. The flashing color light is nice as effects, but not as an indicator of status. I have to keep a reference sheet or lookup online or in the app. Not too helpful. A simple LCD would have sufficed.
* Setup/Installation. Not easy for someone with low to moderate technical expertise. More on this later.
* Price. Also a con. Even though it seems competitively priced, I feel since this is a supply profit-driven product, they could have stood to add that pesky status LCD.
* Auto-shipped Ink. Great concept. I was just sent new ink. I'm not sure why. I'm not sure if part of the bundle. I haven't printed many pages so it isn't used.
* Auto-shipped Ink! One thing that stood out in the documentation is that ink is sent based on printed pages. Not available ink. So if you print a lot, you'll see ink show up when you need it. I assume then that not printing means you'd see fewer shipments. I would like a notification and a requested approval when this happens. I didn't see anything for the first shipment, but I hope there is one for the next. Not so much an issue while in the 6 months free/included period, but probably something others may not like beyond that. Oh, you'll need to keep a credit card on file with HP, too. If they did notifications/approvals, they could have used Apply Pay or something for subscription or individual approved purchases.
* Short-Cuts interface is wonky. It showed all of them grayed out implying they weren't available. But that is just the shading selected for the toggle. I tried configuring the OneDrive shortcut for a ""scan to OneDrive"" use case. But the permissions HP wants are insane. They want access to anything that the owner of the OneDrive account has access to and that isn't acceptable. I use this type of feature on my Brother MFC (which required replacement) and it was not like that at all. You specify a folder and that is it. Needless to say, short-cuts like these won't be used. I'll have to keep using my more bulky laser printer (in the garage) to scan things to the cloud.

Use:
The printer performs as expected. I was hoping for a printer my partner could use to work with photos. You know scrapbook, not super high-quality demands. No commercial use. With respect to text-oriented content with limited graphics, it does work great. But when it comes to larger images on various media, it doesn't do as well as I'd hoped. There is banding along with the image. I think I'll have to use my color laser printer for images that require better though not photo-realistic output as think the inkjet printer is not an improvement.

Initially, I unboxed the unit and I asked my partner to try and set it up. I wanted to see if someone with low-moderate technical expertise could do it. After 30 minutes, he couldn't. So I stepped in. The instruction can be used, but they aren't so clear - partly because of the light strip indicator. If you're colorblind, this might be a problem. Additionally, it periodically loses connectivity to a wireless router that isn't 10 feet away in the same room. Meanwhile, my workhorse laser printer is on another floor and has no issue.

I've owned other HP printers (remember the DeskJets!?), I've even provided technical support for them at one point in my career. These printers don't seem to print better than they do, even if the ink carriage assembly is less bulky.

I wish now that I had selected to replace my trust Brother with another Brother. But I thought HP might be something different to try since my inkjet printing needs aren't as demanding. But even considering its multi-function capabilities, I don't think it stands out.",5 months ago
249,250,6404824,Anonymous,5,Seamless out of box experience and free printing!,"As disappointed (very little use) as I was with the printhead error on my HP OJ Pro 6975 and inability to resolve it I had to move on.

The Out of Box to first print was less than 20 mins. Granted I already had the HP Smart app. loaded and I did work for HP San Diego (where this printer was designed) for 35 years. Regardless HP has come a long ways with the HP Smart application and out of box experience (my only issue is the sticker on the cover was difficult to remove and left a ton of adhesive). 

With HP+ I received an extra year of warranty and 6 months of free printing with new ink on the way via the HP Instant Ink program. The rating was based on first impressions and experience plus what I see as a good value for the money.

I understand that dropping off wireless has been corrected and I like the look and feel of the printer without the control panel. With all of our devices already on hand, why not reduce the cost of the printer by eliminating the standard user interface. The visual lighting features are pretty intuitive. 

I'm ready for the 6 months of FREE - 700 pages or less, printing and then saving money and the added convenience via the Instant Ink program.",7 months ago
250,251,6404824,justjoshin93,3,simple printer for most people,I had gotten this printer because my HP Officejet Pro 7612 Wide format died suddenly (print head issues) and needed a replacement while I get my printer fixed. I went to my local best buy and saw that this was all they had in stock and  everything else was on back order for about a week or so. So I had no other choice and decided to buy it. I'm not a fan of ink used in this device (HP 67 to be exact). The tri-color is one cartridge and then black for the other. They have given me problem with an early printer I had from HP. I feel this one might do the same. I've printed a few documents and a few photos so far and they are pretty decent not flashy or such. The color of the printer is nice but there is no screen. I kinda like the led light bar it has in the front. The setup sucks you have to have a smart phone and download the HP smart Application (available on the Apple App store and Google Play Store) and make sure you have a reliable wireless connection (Wi-Fi). It's not possible to setup through a computer connection it must be setup first by mobile phone.,7 months ago
251,252,6404824,JC1503,5,Envy is right!,"I absolutely love this printer and my spouse is totally envious of it as well. Very appropriately named.

It is so sleek and stylish from the ambient lighting when it is printing to the touch interface that is practically invisible until you need it. That is so cool. At first, I was a little freaked out that it did not have a traditional touch screen. I was thinking, “how am I going to print or copy if I don’t have a touch screen interface?” Well you do have one… if you put a document in the auto feeder or the glass it lights up on the front of the printer for a color copy or black and white copy (see pic)! Otherwise you don’t even notice it…SLEEK!

I also really liked the HP “smart app” HP has developed. I also have an HP Office Jet Pro so I have the Smart app from that but with the Envy, I really dug into it more. It’s also easy to have multiple HP printers in the app and as easy as a single swipe to change from one printer to the next. It is super easy to use and really allows the Printer to become more of a smart printing appliance than just a dumb copy print box. It can print from my photos, or my documents, scan, even camera scan from my phone. With the app and an account, I can easily work from my phones, laptops and tablets all with ease. I also was a little hesitant to sign up for HP plus but with the ink promotion, I did it. You can cancel anytime. You get an extra year of warranty and never have to worry about running out of ink. 

Looks great and has a great app but how does it print?? AMAZING. Again, I love the ambient light when it prints and the nice little melody it plays when it’s done. HP is world class printing and scanning and they get better and faster every year! Fast double sided and auto fed! This truly is the perfect all in one for a modern home office or for kids homework! 

And finally set up? It goes back to the smart app. It’s fun to watch the app talk to the printer and everything just connect and work…so easy which means that there is some great programmers working at HP. Note: don’t rush the printer and app during set up even though you may think nothing is happening it is just setting everything up in the back ground.

I can find a four pack on eBay for a little over $30. It has a print average around 2,500 pages. It also has a toner-saving setting, which I have not used. It only printed black and white.

The only drawback to the printer: it does not have a LAN port. It can only be connected by USB. It can still be shared over a network but it constantly occupies a USB, which matters if desk space or the number of available USB ports is an issue.

I am including some pictures I printed from my phone, slightly edited with the HP Smart app. Some pictures that I scanned and printed with all the default settings, the originals on the left, and the reprints on the right. A comparison picture of a photo printed on photo paper vs plain paper. As well as a print out of some of the Alexa skills that can be used with the printer.


The convenience is missing during the initial setup, but restored afterwards.The printer is pretty easy to use, once everything is set up. Which makes it difficult to understand why setting this printer up is such a hassle.
The entire setup process is kinda tedious and forced. If this printer came with free ink for 5 years, then I could understand the extra hoops for setup and use. With that said, I am a little offended by the lack of freedom surrounding some aspects of this machine. Which is a complete shame, because the printer really is quite nice. It prints extremely fast text documents, and full color glossy photos. You can fax to and from the machine, with a landline, and send faxes directly from your smartphone. It is even pretty easy to add to Alexa or Google assistant. It took less time to set it up with Alexa than it did with HP+ . Linking your printer with Alexa adds the ability to print lists, and some documents on your phone or stored with Alexa. You can even activate some tasks like scan and copy with voice control. With the addition of some more skills, you can print coloring pages, comics, games, puzzles, and recipes, through Alexa's voice control features.


As soon as you turn on the printer, it asks you a few simple questions, then it prompts you to download the HP Smart app on either your pc or smartphone, to finish the setup. It appears that registering your account with the printer is the only way to move forward from here. If you already have an HP account or don't mind signing up for the HP+ service then it shouldn't be a big deal to finish the setup. Afterall you get an extra year's worth of the manufacturer warranty, and 6 months of free ink( to support 100 pages per month of printing). If you prefer not to register right now, you can bypass this screen by pressing the ""?"" on the bottom of the touchscreen, then pressing ""cancel"" on the next 2 screens, and then follow the next few prompts to get to the main menu. Here you can set up your wifi and change any setting you want. The register prompt will pop up again soon restricting some functions, so you will probably want to just register to make things easier for yourself.

One of the good things about the HP Smart app is that it is close to the same layout and function on the computer as it is on the smartphones. Everything is split up by tiles, and has access to account and individual printer settings. Here you can check your page usage for the month, change plans, and review subscription information. All the printer functions like scanning, printing, and faxing can be activated by the tiles. You can even create and activate shortcuts directly from the app tile. Creating shortcuts is actually very easy and can be done in seconds. I'm usually emailing whatever I have to scan, so I made 2 shortcuts for scanning items as searchable PDFs, and emailing pictures.

Another drawback to this printer is the price of ink - if you choose not to join HP+ , you could be spending around $100 for all 4 cartridges.Just as an FYI 3rd party ink will void the HP+ benefits, and most likely disable your machine( if the software can detect the non-HP ink cartridges).So if you enjoy or think you will like HP's instant ink program, then this is definitely the printer for you. The HP+ program claims to be able to save up to 50% off on ink.

I have been printing for a few days, and I am almost out of yellow ink, and the other color cartridges are half empty.To be fair, I have printed 12 ( 8.5x11 photos ) , 10 ( 4x6 photos), and about 50 text document pages, so I am already near my max pages printed for the month.

If you print more than 100 pages per month, you might want to buy the next plan up, otherwise you spend $1.00 for every 10 pages over the 100 for the month.

The Best feature of this printer is the speed. It can print just about any full size photo(8.5""x11"") at high quality in 1minute and 30seconds, give or take a few more seconds based on the photo. For normal quality settings, it only takes 23 seconds to print an 8.5""x11"" photo.  It will also print 4""x6"" photos in 30 seconds, at high quality. 

Even scanning is fast for this machine, it can scan at 300dpi, a 8.5""x11"" photo in 10 seconds.It even offers double sided printing and scanning. With scan resolutions of  75, 150, and 300dpi.

Part of the reason this printer is so quick is because of the 1.2Ghz Processor ,and the 512MBs of memory.

This machine can print black only, or color pages in draft quality at 32PPM. On normal to high quality, it will print black at 22PPM, and color at 18PPM. In contrast most other printers print black at 13 to 15PPM, and color at 11 to 13PPM.

The HP 9015e prints HD quality prints, with 1200x1200 rendered dpi -black and 4800x1200 optimized dpi -color(using HP Advanced Photo Paper).The printer can use any media sizes from 3"" x 5"" up to 13"" x 18"", at 16lbs to 110lbs. This leaves it open to a lot of different potential projects.

Print from anywhere works pretty good, as long as your printer is registered and linked to your account and app. There is a printer setting in the app for ""print anywhere"" that you will have to enable to use the service first, and it's that easy. Just use the HP Smart app like you would normally and select what and how to print it.

Scanning from the PC gets you three automated features, Auto-enhancements , Auto-heal, and Auto-orientation.Advanced Scan is coming to the mobile version soon, which will let you scan multiple objects in one picture shot. Each item will be saved as it's own page, and can be saved as searchable text files. The Advanced Scan also lets you scan books, and will automatically correct curved pages to separate and straighten them out. Auto Heal will remove distracting marks and any other imperfections in your photos.max scan size is 8.5"" x 14"" with ADF
and 8.5"" x 11.7"" flatbed

Faxing is pretty simple, just like with most machines, you enter the phone number and hit send. If you don't have a physical fax cover page, you can create one from the touch screen. You can fax from the flatbed scanner, your phone, or the ADF.The ADF will hold up to 35 pages for faxing or scanning, just keep in mind that if any of your papers are warped or crinkled in any way it might cause pages to stick together when running through the ADF. I always double check my page count, to the printed fax summary reports, to make sure everything went through ok. The 9015e has an impressive 100 speed dial slots, and can store up to 100 pages to fax, just keep in mind it takes about 4 seconds per page to fax something. The fax resolution can be adjusted up to 300 x 300.You can send unlimited faxes from your phone for the trial period, after the trial period the faxes will be limited for free subscriptions. 
You are also eligible for free incoming faxes for 12 months. To save paper on incoming faxes you can enable the 2-sided fax printing.


Overall the print quality and speed of this printer is really exceptional for an office printer, and very good even compared to a photo printer. The HP Smart software is pretty easy to use,  to resize, crop or edit files or pictures. ( just make sure you are using the right print settings before printing for either a document or photo ). The addition of faxing from your phone, creating searchable pdfs, and tailored shortcuts really add back to the convenience of this printer. I am still pretty impressed with how accurate the color matching is on prints compared to original scanned images.",7 months ago
274,275,6450667,Njuice,5,High End Printer That Blends in with Daily Life,"Printer’s are a necessary evil for home life and can be difficult to work with. This HP 9015 Printer really breaks that mold by being so easy to use that it doesn’t feel like a nuisance to use!

PROS:
- The Printer is very well designed! I like the white/gray design and although it has a lot of features, it still feels compact and just blends in with your home or office by not being an eyesore.
- Setting up was very easy! After turning on and putting the ink in, I used the HP Smart App from my iPad. This App made it very smooth and easy to use. Very happy with the setup!
- After setting up, this printer is easily accessible through WiFi from any Windows 10 computer as well as my phone/iPad with the HP Smart App. So printing/scanning was very easy after that!
- To be clear: you do not NEED the HP Smart App to print from a mobile device. I was able to print over WiFi with my iPad Pro without using the App. So you can print without the app but using other features via a mobile device you need the HP Smart App.
- Can confirm this printer prints double sided!! Nice feature!
- Overall it has a lot of nice features needed for a home/office printer. Print’s fast with no errors, scanner, and copier. It will be very useful.

CONS:
- I like how everything is wireless but if for some reason you wanted a hard connection (which you can do), you would have to buy the cord separately . The Printer only comes with Power Cord and Ink.
- I can’t think of many. For the price it takes care of everything I need.

BOTTOM LINE: For my uses, this printer hits everything on the head. It’s ease of use is truly great and makes printing/scanning a seamless process.",2 years ago
275,276,6450667,Nicholas,5,HP Office Jet Pro 9015e with HP+,"HP+ gives you 6 months of free ink and 1 extra year of warranty, when you register for HP+. 
This printer is good for the small business. The 9015e scans your documents faster and does duplex scanning and printing. The black and white documents print at about 22 pages per minute. The color is a bit slower at 18 pages per minute. The 9015e comes with a document feeder. The 9015e is either wireless or USB. The setup is easily completed using the HP Smart App. Open the app with the computer and printer on the same Wi-Fi and follow the on-screen directions. The intelligent self-healing dual band Wi-Fi automatically detects and fixes it's Wi-Fi problems without user input.
HP+ Smart print system keeps your printer ready to print, better security than previous models. With HP+ your get 6 months of ink free. You must register for this service and provide a credit card number for payment on a monthly basis and HP will ship ink depending on which plan you selected during set-up. HP also sends you a return mailer so you can return your used cartridges. Recycled and kept out of the landfills. HP+ does require the user to only utilize HP branded ink cartridges. You can cancel this plan and return to buying your cartridges. However, please note the HP+ ink cartridge’s hold more ink than extra capacity cartridges. There is also one caveat, once you cancel the automatic ink you can no longer use the HP+ cartridges. 
There are on-line resources available to assist you with addition tasks and set up on other devices. 
The quality of the copies and scans is excellent. Printouts in both color and black and white crisp and no bleeding of the ink. The Color touch screen tilts for ease of use. The controls are easily identified on the color screen. 
The Pros of this machine are many. However, I did have a problem with set-up and had to call Support. The phone was answered quickly, and the problem resolved in a few minutes. 
The 9015e is put together well and you can tell the quality of the workmanship.
I would recommend the HP Office Jet Pro 9015e with HP+ to family and friends.",8 months ago
276,277,6450667,MikeJ,5,"Feature packed all-in-one, great performance","I am coming from a Brother printer that is pushing 10 years old at this point. It held up well over time but I was due for a more modern upgrade.

Initial setup of this HP Officejet Pro was quick and easy. The mobile application and Windows HP Smart software was easy to use, and I had my printer connected to my wireless network and Google Drive in minutes. Prints are crisp, clear, and fast. I also noticed that this unit works fairly quietly, which is nice. Scanning features are great, and easy to perform with the mobile app, save as a pdf, and email without having to use a computer. The computer software is also full-featured, but it is convenient to control everything from a phone in front of the printer as well. Options and settings can be changed on the fly without walking back and forth to your computer. The touchscreen interface on the printer is quick and easy, reminds me of an older Android phone, it works well. Overall I am happy with this printer and would recommend it to anyone running a small business, or just needs a step up in quality and features for overall home use.",2 years ago
277,278,6450667,RandallFlagg,5,Nice all in one printer. Great for a home office,"Opening the box, I find the printer, 4 ink cartridges (black, cyan, yellow, and magenta…as usual), a power cord and install instruction as well as an HP+ brochure. It all looks complete and ready to install except for taking the tape off. But wait, what’s this grey button and black piece with a spring on it. Oh man, I hope it’s not broken. I examine the printer and flip it upside down, then I see the hole in the outfeed tray. I pull it out and press the other button. The tray comes out and I can see its twin on the underside. I take a few minutes to orientate the two pieces and after a second try, I get it to click in. The button has a big and small tab and goes in one way, at least that’s how it looked to me. Anyway, now ready to install. 

I plug the unit in and the printer powers up. It goes through a few steps and asks to connect with my network via Wi-Fi. That’s when I discover I’ve been running my main desktop just on a LAN cable. I run the Windows troubleshooter and it can’t help. It says to try a driver, so off to the HP site to find the Wi-Fi driver for my model. I download it and tada, Wi-Fi appears in my network. I connect and it sees the printer in the HP Smart app. I don’t need my phone to install the printer. I click on the discovered printer and it starts setup. As it does, I go to the HP+ webpage, and based on my needs, I don’t want the service. To be completely honest, I was on the fence as I read about the service and I think I would have signed up if doing so didn’t lock the printer into using only genuine ink. I like the savings it offered, and the 3x roll-over credit is allowed, but as these printers age, I like the option to buy 3rd party ink just as a cheap printing option. Many times, I print articles or store coupons and I hate to use good expensive ink for those types of jobs. If HP would have left that option available, I would have signed up. So, after saying no to HP+, the printer asks to print an alignment sheet. I click yes and it takes a bit and seems to stall, but it finally gets the job done and then asks to scan the sheet. The instruction in the 2.7” touchscreen display wasn’t the easiest to read. I wasn’t sure which direction to turn the page, although it was easy to see the top left corner was the alignment spot. I chose a direction and figured it would let me know if I needed to flip it and rescan. No problem though, it said finished and ready to print. I must say that this is probably the easiest printer I’ve installed in Windows and I have 3 HP printers running through the HP Smart app, as well as 3 other branded printers currently running.

What else can I say about a printer? Well, the construction is your basic printer build. Lots of plastic and in my case a small part lying in the box waiting for me to reinstall it. The touchscreen CGD is nice and responsive. The paper feed tray is okay, but the spring-loaded (catch??) is a bit of a pain. I need to remember to hold it down when I return it. Without a spring-like many of my other printers, I just push it back in. I do like that the unit leans toward connecting with Wi-Fi, but still offers a LAN port and USB port. The printer doesn’t come with either cable, so be ready with the correct cable if this is your preferred choice. It has a convenient USB port on the side, not sure why USB 2.0 still, but maybe that’s all one needs to print with. I just figured anything new would offer USB 3.0 first. This model does have automatic two-sided printing and a 35-page auto-feeder. Oh, and I forgot because I don’t use it, but it can fax and has the two phone ports in the back. I haven’t had it but a couple of days, but it says it has auto healing Wi-Fi, so it tries to reconnect if the connection is lost. 

One last thing I forgot to add during setup. At the very end, it allowed me to email myself a link to use on my other computers, tablets, and phone. I sent it to my daily email account and then whatever device I’m using, I can just click and install that device and print wirelessly. Nice.

Oops, one more thing. Not sure why and if it matters, but in the install and HP Smart app, the printer is listed as HP OfficeJet Pro 9010 series. Since it's a 9015e, that 9010 messed me up for a second. Just FYI.",8 months ago
278,279,6450667,Alicia,5,Great all in one for small offices,"I bought this all in one printer when it became difficult to buy ink for my last printer. Installation is easy, paper jams are easy to clear, prints clearly and quickly, scans better than my last printer.",1 year ago
279,280,6450667,Njuice,5,"Easy to use, yet High End Wireless Printer","For people who work from home or have small businesses, having a reliable printer is still really important! And with the way that we are starting to work, we need one that thinks ahead and is very easy to use at a moments notice. The HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e Printer has truly met my needs and beyond!

PROS:
- I really like the look of this printer. The shape, the white/gray tones, and the overall design just give it a modern feel while not feeling too clunky or out of place.
- Setup was truly a breeze! The printer is largely ready to go besides plugging it in, connecting it to the internet, and putting in the ink cartridges. It just was really nice to have no assembly required and it being ready to go so quickly.
- The HP Smart app (which is on Windows, Android, iPhone/iPad) is really a fantastic tool for this printer. It helps you manage everything on there, shows ink levels, and is just a well developed app to use.
- I can’t stress how nice the wireless aspect is of this printer. Being able to easily access the printer from my phone, tablet, or laptop really makes getting this done so much easier then having to be physically connected to the printer or wirelessly adding the printer through an over complicated process.
- Once set up, the printer works great! For printing it is very fast and accurate, while also being able to print double sided.
- It can scan/copy things through the document feeder or through the actually scanner which is really nice versatility to have, especially if you need to scan a lot of documents at once.
- The Color touchscreen is also really nice to have! It adds a nice feature if needed, shows the printing status, but blends in nicely when you don’t need it.
- HP+ is included in with this and I am quite impressed with it! Basically its a service that will ship you more ink when you need it without having to think about it, plus they offer ways to recycle your old cartridges which I think is a great sustainable idea. It’s a really nice feature to have to help you be more productive with your printer.

CONS:
- I don’t have any issues with this printer that I can think of or that I have run into so far. For my needs it works great.

BOTTOM LINE:
- If you work from home or have a small business and need a printer that can do it all for you, look no further than this one! The printing, scanning, copying features all work really well plus its highly accessible with its wireless hookups and HP+ membership along with it. I have really enjoyed using this printer and I think you will too.",8 months ago
280,281,6450667,DavidJr,4,"Mobile minutes plan, but for printers?","As far as printers go, HP has always been a top choice. This OfficeJet Pro 9015e is a great example of a simple All-in-One to get the job done. Full duplex scanning and printing, fairly quick printing for an inkjet, fax and all the online features that you can imagine. The initial setup is simple and even calibration is done with a single print then scan page. Using this printer is very similar to using one of those much larger and more costly office machines, but more compact and reasonable. 

A downside to inkjet printers in general is the added dry time needed to prevent smearing. Though this printer can print reasonably fast, if you are doing duplex printing, it has to stop and let the page dry for a few seconds between each page. Another issue I have had with inkjets is that if you aren’t using them on a regular basis, the nozzles will dry up causing print issues till you run a cleaning process. Sometimes it is so bad that it ends up needing new parts. However, this printer and the HP+ program is intended for people that intend to use the printer on a regular basis.

The HP+ program is an interesting program that essentially allows you to subscribe for a monthly fee to disperse your ink cost over a per month basis rather than burst whenever you run low. With your printer connected to the internet and a credit card configured with the account, it will automatically request ink when it gets low and within a couple days a box with complete ink replacements will arrive. Even though I was low on Cyan and Yellow only, all four cartridges were received and I await for the printer to be run to a “Very Low” status to be replaced. This is absolutely convenient, but to me has a really strange similarity to old mobile minute plans.

When you sign up for HP+ you have to decide how many pages you think you will print per month which affects the monthly price. The recommended was 100 pages per month but the top one is 700 pages. This is where it starts looking more like a mobile phone plan as you have roll over pages and you get charged extra per set of pages that you go over on the plan you have selected. The good thing is, you get 6 months free, so during that six months you can see your average use and decide on the plan that suits you best. The cartridges installed say they average about 700 pages black and 300 pages color, but I have printed 132 pages, in which about 50 were 4x6 photos, and I was already low on ink. The good side to this is that they claim the plan is based on pages, not ink. Though I am over my 100 pages intended, I already have a new set of ink cartridges. This however, leads to the next thing that reminds me of old phone plans, if you aren’t paying for the subscription, you aren’t able to print.

In the terms it points out that the Instant Ink cartridges can only be used if the printer is online and you have an active subscription. If the subscription is canceled, the cartridges will be deactivated and the only way you can continue to use the printer is to buy the commercial off the shelf cartridges. The plan could be budget friendly if you happen to print a lot of full page content, but if you are just printing a few forms and not really using much ink, you may be spending more in the long term, especially if you have times where you are getting charged more per extra 10 pages. At least it has the roll over pages, so if I only print 10 pages this month, I have 190 available next month, up to 3 months worth saved up.

As for the printer itself, I like all the features it has. The quality of the prints are nice, speed is decent, interaction with computers and mobile devices is pretty fluid. The HP Smart app gives you additional features and makes printing, scanning and faxing from anywhere a breeze. The HP+ program on the other hand really is dependent on your average usage. Take the 6 month free trial to evaluate your average usage compared to the amount of ink used and possibly consider getting the cartridges off the shelf before your trial ends so that you can continue printing if you cancel your subscription.",8 months ago

I bought a new HP OfficeJet Pro 9015, thinking I would be as pleased with performance as I had been for many years with the HP Envy. The Envy was old and slow (with no document feeder) so it was time to “upgrade”. 
   My upgrade turned out to be a downgrade. All four corners must be adjusted separately and there is no automatic feature, or snap, to help maintain the integrity of the corners. You just eyeball it and hope it’s close enough. It takes at least 6 adjustments (sometimes more) to get it right. The old one usually got it with 1 adjustment. 
   Also, with the old HP Envy, you could enter the measurements for scanning and that eliminated the need for any adjustments at all. This feature was also removed with the new scanner.

288,289,6450667,Crasher,5,Printer with the speed of a laser jet,"The HP Office Jet Pro offers the speed and reliability you would expect to see with HP products. With the use of modern day technology implemented in their printers, HP has improved both the speed and quality of their printing process. With the added feature of HP+ you no longer need to worry with keeping up with your printers updates, ink cartridges or disposal. Let's dive in and see what makes this newest flagship a bit different.

Out of the box you get everything you need to get started, which really isn't a whole lot. You get the main printer, power cord, the four ink cartridges necessary to print, and a set of instructions. What i really like about the printer is the fact that the only cord i have is the power cord. You have one outlet for the ethernet cable and another for USB printing but other than that this unit is really meant to shine with the use of wireless technology. So how easy is set up on your PC? Really easy in fact. Set up took about 5 mins, and that included a update for the printer. All you need to do is download the free HP Smart app for either PC, Apple, IOS or Android and follow the step by step instructions. Through the app on your phone you can easily print directly from your phone to your printer. The printer also comes with a built in LCD screen so you can also manually do everything through the touch screen as well. I don't want to spend to much time on the touch screen but some of the items you can do is print, scan, adjust your settings and even print passport photos, to name just a few. Where this unit really shines versus its previous model that i noticed right away was the speed and quality of the print jobs. For being your typical ribbon wire printer, these units have always been slow and noisy. The HP Office Jet is a lot more faster than its predecessors with the speed that almost feels like a good quality laser jet printer. The print quality is superb leaving no streaking or breaks in the print job. For the most part its your standard printer that your used to owning. It prints, scans, sends emails and can even print photos and passports. But what is meant to make it stand out besides its speed and quality is the added feature of HP+. So lets talk about HP+ here for a minute. HP+ is a added feature that is free however it is meant to be combined with HP instant ink. So what the HP+ does is give you a extra year of warranty for your printer but it also allows HP to monitor your printer to help improve performance. HP+ will monitor when updates are needed, it will readjust the ink jets when it feels it needs it and when combined with HP instant ink HP will monitor your ink levels and when they start to get low they will automatically send you new ink cartridges with a free return slip so that you can send them back free of charge to be properly recycled. Obviously there is a monthly fee associated with this subscription.

Overall guys this is a printer just like every other printer you have seen. But what makes it truly shine is the speed of the print and the fact that the printer monitors itself through HP+ and adjust itself and updates itself as necessary. In a busy world sometimes i don't have time to keep up with all the minor things like buying ink or checking to make sure it has the latest firmware update. For me what really got me sold was the speed of the print and the fact that they pretty much monitor and take care of my printer needs for me along with providing me with ink before i run out. Check it out and let HP handle all the trivial stuff.",8 months ago
289,290,6450667,UnkinB,5,great office addition,"I have a couple of rent houses so the HP Office Jet Pro 9015e is a great addition to my office. 
Lets start with the basics, it can print up to 22 pages per minute black and 18 pages per minute color. It can print single or double sided, it can scan single or double sided. It has a letter size scanning bed but can also feed paper through the document feeder. It also can fax if that is what you need. It accepts many sizes and types of paper. It also has a touch led screen. 
You can connect the HP 9015e by USB, Ethernet cable or WIFI. The best features come when you connect via WIFI. You can download the HP Smart app to your phone and print from your phone’s gallery, Dropbox, Google Drive, email or the cloud. You can also connect it to your network and share it across all your devices to streamline printing and scanning. The Smart app also allows the HP 9015e to scan to your phone or fax an email. 
The print quality is clear, and the text is readable even at a small print size. The scanner will scan up to 300 dpi through the feeder and up to 1200 dpi on the scanner glass. 
One of the biggest features when connected via WIFI is the HP+ it gives you an extra year of warranty. It gives you free ink and being on Wi-Fi it can monitor when your ink is getting low and let you order before you run out. With HP+ you send back your used ink cartridges in a prepaid envelope so HP can repurpose them to create new cartridges. 
With HP+ you sign up for Instant Ink which is a Printing Plan that has a monthly fee depending on how much you print, and they will send you ink as it is needed. If you print around 100 pages a month the fee is $4.99 a month. To buy the ink yourself it will cost around $120.00 to replace all of the cartridges. It would take 2 years at $5.00 a month to match that cost. HP says you should save around 50% on the cost of your ink. Sounds like a good deal to me.",8 months ago
290,291,6450667,Tstall,3,I was expecting more.,"First off I wanted to say is this has super easy packaging for removing the printer out of the box. The printer is wrapped in a plastic bag with handles to pull the machine out and not cause damage.

Setting up the printer was fairly easy. However, the ink cartridge slots are very cheaply made. When you click in the cartridge the spring loaded action is very finicky. They didn’t really just click in? I had to double check every cartridge to make sure they were secured before closing the lid. After I followed the directions of setup I turned on the printer and it made horrible loud noises. It was still working and nothing was incorrect it was just that the internals are not very good quality (in my opinion). 

Software installation was quick and easy on my pc. Was setup and connected to my wifi it automatically appeared on my iPhone printer list with out extra apps or installation processes. I did download the hp iOS app which has great features. It even allows you to print anywhere you are (without being connected to the wifi). If you prefer you can even send prints to your printer and when you get home just click print so your prints are not just hanging out for all to see. 

*You must sign up for HPs ink plan with a source of payment in order to get 6 months of free ink. Which is a pretty good deal. 

The printer has all of your normal functions including print , copy, fax, and scan. It has gotten quite as I have used it. Maybe it just needs to be used a few times to not make as much noise. Also the highest it will allow me to duplex scan on top is 300dpi. I usually prefer 600dpi (depending on the items I and scanning) but it does work very well and is quick enough for me. 

I would have given this item 4 stars if the internal quality was better. I am not sure if this printer will last for years? Outside the printer looks and is built great; just not the inside.",8 months ago
291,292,6450667,Kariskilled,4,decent printer overall,"Love the features of print, scan copy and fax. Yes faxing is possible using the hp fax service  using h hpsmart print app. Minus one star though for photo print quality, Not the best if your looking for hd studio quality prints. And Also I’ve had a few jams after loading paper and also different sized photos sheets. HP could have done a better job with the tray. It’s easy to assume the paper is loaded correctly with how the tray was designed, but once the printer begins to feed on the sheets if not placed correctly, it can easily cause a jam",1 year ago

300,301,6219261,Trobadour,3,Faded Images Faded My Expecattions,"---SETUP---
The setup of this inkless, wireless photo printer is quick. It takes about one hour to charge out of the box, but can be used while it’s charging. After turning it on once, it sends a bluetooth signal that your mobile device will recognize, much like pairing a new set of bluetooth headphones. Select the printer and your phone is now paired to it. You are required to download the Canon Mini Print App to interact with the printer. I had a little bit of trouble opening the lid to insert the paper but the app itself does a better explanation as to how to open it and get that paper installed.

---FEATURES---
Some key feature of this photo printer is that it doesn’t use ink, it’s highly portable, doesn’t require to be plugged in thanks to it’s included internal rechargeable battery, and it’s completely wireless to print photos. 

---PERFORMANCE---
The printer works as intended. In about 40 seconds, you can print a picture that you have already taken prior to the purchase of this printer or one that you take from within the Canon Mini Print App itself. Taking pictures from within the app guarantees that the image will fit perfectly on the paper. Using my own pictures, I discovered that the image will be too large and be cropped out to fill the white space of the paper. You can add borders that can be downloaded to fix that for free within the app, as well as other neat digital stickers. The app allows you to add text and even has masks, akin to SnapChat. All of these optional features aren’t pre-downloaded with your app. This is good for people who may not have too much memory on their phone and instead only download the stickers they plan to use at the time. 

---EXPECTATIONS---
The printer mildly meets my expectations. The prints that come out look faded compared to how you see them on your mobile device. Though you can color correct within the app before printing, the color doesn’t quite come out the way you want it to, but it’s still satisfactory enough for a fun little gift. Additionally, the back of the photos can be removed and the photos then become stickers. If you don’t want to use it as a sticker, the photos make great wallet pictures, as they are 2 by 3 inches. The printer did loose connection to my phone multiple times, but it found it after waiting a few seconds. 

---VALUE---
The price for the printer in terms of value is good only if you plan on using it often. You have to add the price of buying this specialty paper, as it is currently 9.99 for a 20 sheet pack or 24.99 for a 50 sheet pack. There’s no benefit to buying larger quantities as the pricing is comparatively the same quantity vs. price. Buying the printer does come with a 10 sheet pack. Doing the math at current prices, it’s a little over .55 cents per printed sheet, factoring in taxes. 

---APPROVAL---
I highly recommend this product for people who enjoy scrapbooking, decorating their technology with stickers, or have lockers or other flat surfaces of their choice to decorate. This wouldn’t be a good printer for everyday use for most users. It feels more like a novelty item than a useful tool, but I can see people setting up photo booths using these printers. Add some props, customize your images within the app, print, and have fun!",3 years ago
301,302,6219261,EVA23,5,Great photo printer,Purchased this mini photo printer for my niece on her birthday. Best photo printer she’s had she loves it. Prints great photos. the rose gold color of printer is just fabulous!,2 years ago
302,303,6219261,nickcal,5,Perfect option for printing out individual photo,"As our world becomes more and more digital, I find myself really enjoying paper products even more. They are becoming more rare with each year — each month that passes. One of the most precious pieces of paper is a photograph and it’s probably also one of the most rare these days. We typically just open up a photo on our phone and pass it around to family and friends but it’s really hard to compare to a printed photo to hang on your wall or place in a frame. Fortunately, some camera companies like Canon have started creating personal photo printers that allow you to print directly from your mobile phone. 

The Canon Ivy Printer comes packaged in a simple but nicely branded box. It’s very easy to unbox and it comes with a short (about 6 inches) Micro USB cable, a visual quick start card, and some paperwork about safety and warranty regulations. The complete manual is available within the mobile app and that is, in fact, the first step in the set-up process — downloading the app. It’s a free app and is available for both iOS and Android devices. 

Once the printer is charged, you can connect to it via Bluetooth. At this point, the user experience is highly involved with the mobile app. You can either take photos and print them immediately or select photos that are already stored on your phone. When you select a photo, the app will adjust it so that it fits the photo size of the printer. This is a simple photo editing program built into the app and with it you can easily add text and/or stickers to the photo before you print it. This feature is a little like editing photos in Snapchat before you send it to friend.s. It’s a nice feature to have but not something you have to use if you don’t like it. In addition to the markup options, you can also brighten your photos, change their tint, and adjust their contrast. Because the editing details are all described by icons, it’s a little difficult to determine which control is which. 

As a test, I pulled a photo from my Camera Roll on my iPhone of a pair of bookends. The photo shows a colorful, detailed desk accessory and I wanted to have it printed out to see if the detail of the photo remained. I’ve actually had the opportunity to use a different pocket printer by a different company and the colors weren’t very vibrant and details weren’t very prominent once the image was printed. The same is not true of the Canon Ivy printer. The photo was bright, colorful and you could see all the fine details the same way you would if you were looking at it on the phone screen. 

The printer does make quite a bit of mechanical/roller noise as it prints. I was surprised about this considering how small the device is. It wasn’t loud per se but it wasn’t quiet either. The first time you print a photo from the printer, the blue information sheet will feed out of the printer first. This will happen every time you print using a new package of ZINKTM photo sheets. Once the blue sheet fed through the printer, it took about one minute for the photo to print out. 

The Ivy photo printer from Canon is the perfect option for someone who takes frequent photos with their phone but would like to have a printed keepsake. The Ivy printer is small and very easy to take with you from place to place. I would recommend this to all types of users and think that people who like adding embellishments to photos would really get a kick out of the photo editing options.",3 years ago
303,304,6219261,TECHBEENGOOD,5,Possibly Perfect Party Printer,"Party? Whaaat? And by party I also include any celebration, reunion, anniversary and get together. Think about it. This Canon Ivy printer easily slips into a jacket or larger purse, reliably connects to your phone, and invites you to share photos of an event right then, right there. Pull together a group, take a picture with your phone, and send it to your mini-printer so you can share the memories right now. It really is this easy.

Point: The pictures are only 2x3”, so why do I want this?
Answer: The printer can be a very portable at 4.7“ x 3.2“ x 0.7” and . . this is a great tool for social engagement.

Point: It would be nice to grab photos from my camera roll, but also from Instagram, or Drop Box or Facebook.
Answer: Any or all of the above are accessible and managed from within the App. 

Point: With no printer ink and just thermal printing it’ll look weird, right? 
Answer: Shockingly nice looking photos spit out of this thing in under 30 seconds and NO need for ink supplies, ‘cause there is no ink to replenish! The resulting prints resist smudges, don’t tear, and peel-and-stick. And they are pretty.

Point: I’d prefer the opportunity to get creative using my computer’s photo software and the Canon Ivy is only for Android or iOS mobile phones.
Answer:The Canon print App lets you do some edits, add effects, filters, make collages or larger tiled prints using the Android or iOS App.

Point: I’m guessing my grandparents are going to pass on this new gadget.
Answer: Eh . . . well it’s all icon based and most of them can be figured out by a child, but that’s the rub. You can certainly charge ahead and get nice results. But, easy to read (not gray on white, mini-type) would be really nice. 

Point: It’s going to need power while I’m on the go.
Answer: It’s rechargeable (takes 75 minutes) and doesn’t require a power supply at the party.

Point: I’m going to need a bunch of prints at my parties so what’s needed?
Answer: The printer accepts packs of 10 prints at one time and they are really easy to load and carry. 

Summary: These are going to be popular at parties.",3 years ago
304,305,6219261,TechMatcher,5,Very cool and fun!,"Every once in a while a product come along that really impresses me. This Canon IVY mini photo printer is definitely one of those! I've impressed more that a few people at recent graduation parties by taking a selfie with the new grad and pulling this little printer out of my pocket and creating an instant photo for them! They absolutely love it!

There are a couple things to know:
1. Takes about 30 seconds to print a picture. Kinda long, but for the convenience and cool factor - not bad.
2. It holds 10 sheets of paper and you should buy paper by the 50 pack. You'll burn through them quickly at a party as everybody wants a photo shot.
3. The pictures are really convenient wallet size - people throw them in their wallet and carry them around.
4. Full charge takes a little over an hour.

The software (app) is basically a full featured software editor! You can add text, frames, graphics - very cool! This is one device I'm going to carry around with me - might even earn a spot in my backpack for a while!

A quick note is that I would recommended a bundle purchase of more paper, tether strap and a carrying case!

I did this with one photo that was taken indoors. I played around with the borders and looked at some of the other effects you can do. The only issue I have had is the printer not always connecting to my phone. I will check the bluetooth setting and choose the printer. It says it connected but it wasn't showing up in the app. I turned off bluetooth and turned it on again, that fixed that issue.

Good tech's once (and if) you call.

Copy, paste from an Amazon reviewer (mathgeek669) - 

Go to the Brother website and download the latest drivers for your printer and install all of the software on your computer. DO NOT use the CD that comes with the printer. It could have been sitting in a warehouse for 6 months or a year for all you know, and the drivers are probably not up to snuff. When the software installation reaches the point where you have to opportunity to update all of the software and firmware from the printer, do it. Do not skip that portion of the installation process. There is a sticker on the back of your printer with the ""password"" that it will ask for when you choose to remotely configure it, and within those settings, you have the wonderful option of setting the ""Toner-Low"" setting to ""Continue"" instead of ""Stop"".",6 months ago

And I have to say, having a fax feature is a god-send that I didn't realize I needed! Now that I'm working from home, I need to send sensitive information and emailing attachments isn't safe. The fax set-up took a few seconds and 30 pages were received quickly. One downside, it doesn't provide a fax confirmation page, but the recipient sent a quick email so I can live with that. Out of the box, I've printed about 100 pages and it's still going strong. I want to toss my HP color inkjet out the window!!! That thing is a waste of money, time and space.

353,354,6461498,elitegangsta,5,Great Value Inkjet Printer,"The biggest problem with buying an inkjet printer in the past has been the value proposition. While the printer itself is fairly inexpensive, the ink costs fat exceed the actual value you get out of the printer. This is where the Brother ""INKvestment tank"" comes in. Brother advertises up to a year worth of ink in the box when you purchase one of these printers as well as up to a year of ink when you replace the cartridge. This is a game changer for the inkjet industry and when purchasing a new printer, and economics is a concern, you can now add an inkjet back in the mix of your laser printer choices and save some cash in the process!

I have not had the opportunity to deplete the cartridge yet, but I have used it as my main printer for about a month in total and the ink levels are still in the 90%. I'm not a heavy printer user normally, but this past month has been income taxes, numerous shipping labels, general office related documents, and in all, i've consumed about a ream of paper total (500 sheets).

This printer is super easy to setup. I chose to join it to my WiFi using the iOS app. Setup took all of about 10 minutes. Once setup and on my WiFi, i went to my computers and installed the Brother printer driver, again, super simple on a Windows 10 machine, took about 5 minutes total. On my macs, simply adding as an airprint printer was all that was needed. Installing the official driver just added the scanner functionality to the OS.

The touchscreen interface on the printer itself is super minimal and easy to use. Copy, scan, print is VERY easy, Just click the corresponding button and you're done. These same buttons and functionality are present in the desktop application. This desktop application is super minimal and simple. I found this pleasant but others may need more advanced features, though Brother supplies a TWAIN driver for use of applications like Photoshop or others to be used for advanced scanning.

There are two trays on this printer, a top tray that supports about 200 sheets and the lower tray that is another 300. Together they support a full ream of paper. 

My largest complaint is that there is a sleep setting that can only be set to a maximum of 9 minutes. When in sleep mode, sending print jobs did not ""wake"" the printer for me and I had to walk to it and wake it up. Adding in the ability to turn off this feature would be nice.

Scanning is fast and easy however the scanning feeder only holds 17-20 sheets. This is fine for my needs and likely most people, though heavier scanner users may need a larger feeder.

Printing is quick and of nice quality. The initial setup requires you to go through some calibration, but afterwards prints came out clear, of nice color, and fairly fast. 

This printer works great on iOS using the AirPrint feature as well. The printer was easily found and printed out anything I asked it to do with ease. 

All in all this is a great simple to use printer with the promise of added value by more economical ink tanks. I recommend this printer to anyone looking for such features. More ""power users"" will likely want to look elsewhere though.",6 months ago
354,355,6461498,MrGadget,5,"Brother MFC-J4535DW inexpensive, full featured","Brother MFC-J4535DW INKvestment Tank Color Inkjet Printer, brand new and just $200 at Best Buy, offers easy set up and robust performance for homes and small businesses. With up to one year of ink in the box, based on up to 150 pages per month, and in typical Brother fashion, this new model offers more for less than ever before. You’re going to like this printer!

I’ve used and recommended Brother printers, both monochrome (black & white) laser and inkjet, for nearly 20 years. I find them to be excellent printers as well as long lasting and more economical to operate than competitive brands.

**WHAT’S IN THE BOX**

• Brother MFC-J4535DW COLOR inkjet printer
• Starter INKvestment cartridges in Black, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow.
• Startup guide, warranty

**THE SETUP**

What is Brother INKvestment? This is the company’s hybrid ink cartridge with internal ink tanks system. How does it work? During setup and after the four provided starter ink cartridges are installed, this printer primes and fills sealed internal tanks from the ink in the cartridges. According to Brother, “INKvestment TANK cartridges still plug into the machine like a normal cartridge. No messy bottles to worry about. Think of the new cartridges like a water cooler bottle - there are no mechanisms on the bottle - all the working parts are in the body of the cooler. The same is true with the new INKvestment TANK cartridges - they are a reservoir for ink. All the mechanisms for removal of air bubbles and feeding to the printhead are located inside the printer's sub-tank assembly.

There is no ink waste - the cartridges are completely drained into the sub-tank. There is no remaining ink needed in the cartridges to protect the print head. Because the system is completely closed, there are no concerns about the ink drying up. As long as the machine remains connected to a power source, it is able to regulate the humidity and keep the ink fresh and ready to use.

Once the cartridges are ‘empty,’ there are approximately 200 pages of usage in the sub-tank.
New intelligent Ink Meter... aka Page Gauge... will not only allow you to check to remaining ink volume, but you'll also be able to see an approximate count of the number of pages remaining for each color. This can be shown as an ISO page count or User page count based on actual printing habits.”

Two sets of replacement ink are offered, standard yield said to be about 3,000 copies and high yield rated at about 6,000 pages or copies. This model is so new that replacement ink is not yet listed or available, so I am unable to provide price information.

Setup follows the proscribed path in the easy-to-follow instructions, with the emphasis on EASY.

After plugging in, follow instructions to install the provided ink. While waiting, follow the advice on the 2.7"" color display to load some paper into either or both internal trays holding a total of about 400 pages, and then perform other settings during the approximate four-minute internal setup. INKvestment follows this path after the initial set of ink cartridges are installed. During the wait, this is when ink is pulled from the cartridges into the sealed internal tank system to partially fill it in readiness for print jobs. The internal setup is completed after a test copy is printed and another step is completed for the purpose of assuring that the on-board scanner performs accurately. And, of course, it did.

According to a Brother representative, another INKvestment technology advantage avoids the occasional head cleaning cycles experienced with other products and technologies. The sealed tanks and air-free delivery system is more ink efficient. When ink cartridges are replaced, there is no waste from priming as is customary with conventional color inkjet systems. Once installed, the new ink flows to refill internal tanks where required.

Next, the Brother Mobile Connect software was downloaded and installed on an iPhone, iPad and Android phone. Similarly, both Mac and Windows software for Brother printers was installed on two computers. The new printer was wirelessly connected to our home Wi-Fi network on the 2.4 GHz band only, as that is how printers and most other IoT (Internet of Things) devices join our networks. Finally, the new printer was added in the conventional way to both Macs and Windows PCs here and the printer firmware was checked for any needed updates. None was needed. And now, let’s put it to the test!

**PUT TO THE TEST**

This was so simple, as it should be. Duplex print, copy and scan, plus fax performed successfully, flawlessly. Going deeper, I printed documents in black & white in both highest quality and normal mode. Color photos on high quality photo paper at highest quality looked beautiful, though this is not presented as a photo printer. Faxes went through without issue when sent from a digital document on my computer as well as from documents scanned in the on-board ADF with approximately 25-page capacity. 

The Brother Mobile Connect app performed perfectly, accessing controls for printing documents and photos, scanning, copying and a maintenance button to poll ink supplies. Scan history can be stored through the app. I was able to print documents and photos from mobile devices as well as print from content in all the usual cloud services to this printer. I set up document and photo scanning, as well. It operates smoothly, easily and intuitively.

**CONCLUSION**

Ideal for high quality, low monthly COLOR printing volume, Brother MFC-J4535DW is highly recommended by this reviewer.

355,356,6461498,KKCNIck,5,Excellent printer with 1YR of Ink included,"I have owned several printers from popular manufacturers but have had two that stopped working recently after a fairly short period of time so I am looking forward to trying something new with expanded features. This is the Best Brother Printer I have used yet. With the trends of having Ink programs this comes with it which is better than some subscription models out there with other manufacturers.

Unboxing & Physical Features:
The printer comes extremely well packaged with thick boxing and Styrofoam inserts. Whether you are picking this up from the store or having it shipped, I don’t think you’ll have any concerns! The printer is solid and the perfect size for my use and space. I am a moderate user. I use the different features of an all-in-one printer but since I’m not utilizing if for anything particularly professional with high-volume, I don’t want it to take up a ton of space. So, I especially love that all the features that matter to me are packed into reasonable dimensions and the printer is not extremely tall. It fits perfectly in my desk credenza cabinet with only 11.25 inches of vertical space. I can get to the top document feeder and/or lift the top lid just enough to use it for scanning and copying. Also, everything can be accessed from the front! Most importantly, the ink loads right from the front so I wouldn’t need to take the printer out to load the ink! Also, the power cable is in the back, but extends from the left side. PERFECT for me because you can slide the printer back into the shelf without losing space or concern of smashing the cord.

Setting up:
This was a piece of cake. There are simple printed instructions but you can honestly just follow the prompts. Plug it in, load the paper, pop in the ink cartridges, check the alignment and you’re set! The ink cartridges are the simplest that I have ever had on a printer. With my previous printers, I had to pull them out of the shelf and open the whole unit to access the ink on the inside. With this one, you just flip down the front port and pop them in. They click in perfectly and extremely fast. BRILLIANT. It takes just a few minutes for the new ink to load and to do the recommended alignment. This is a standard process that my other printers had. If you’ve never done this before, it prints a test page that you place back on the scanner for it to check and self-adjust.

I do not use a hardwired Ethernet cable or phone/fax line. So for me it was just finding the wifi, entering the password and it was on the network in seconds and ready to go. 

General Use:
The printer has a small LCD full color touch screen on a panel that can be tilted for a better viewing angle. For me it is perfect because my printer cabinet is near the floor and I can tilt the panel up to see without having to get on the floor. The screen leads you to all the functions like scans/copying/sending to web apps/etc. and to adjust settings. The menus are intuitive and the layout is simple. It is not complicated or overwhelming. You can also download the app on your mobile device to check ink levels, adjust settings or print/scan/copy through the app. Pretty cool! This printer has 2 trays which combined should hold about 400 sheets (a whole pack is 500). This is an upgrade over my previous printer. 

Printer/Copier:
Printing from from a laptop and mobile device is simple. Very short lag for warm up time and printing is fast and the printer is not too loud. The text comes out crisp and clear on standard settings. I have not tried photo printing but I did print a presentation including graphics and a photo and the colors turn out very clear and accurately reflect what I see on my computer/device screen. I’ve printed different documents from different applications and all have the same great results. My disclaimer is that I don’t have much experience in photo printing or extensive printing of significant color documents so I’m not able to comment on that.

Copying is easy and the top document feeder is really nice to have. Since the overall form factor of this machine is modest, I don’t think the document feeder is intended for a huge stack of pages to copy but I believe it will work for most of my needs. 

Scanner:
I tend to use this feature frequently on my printers. To scan and email, it was just a matter of entering my email addresses and it saves those for you for ongoing use. I’ve always relied on the scan to pdf approach and email and this worked without a hitch. However, there are other features like sending straight to your google drive, dropbox, Evernote, etc or even scanning to other file formats like word or power point. I will be experimenting with these features over time. 

Conclusion:
I’m not sure how long the ink will last or the cost of the replacement cartridges and it seems that is always the unknown component of printers. However, for me this printer is excellent. You can set it up and use it right away, the size is right, the features are right and the quality meets all my applications.",7 months ago
356,357,6461498,RonH,3,Middle of the road,"Brother MFC-J4535

The Brother MFC-J4535 Inkvestment ink jet printer resembles most of Brother’s other MFC printers. Primarily plastic with plastic pieces. This is my second MFC printer and other than a few design changes they are pretty much the same. 

The J4535 is an “INKvestment” model, using a larger ink tank cartridge to fill a smaller internal tank on the print heads. I guess this is to compete with Epson’s ecotank line. The unit ships with what Brother called the “starter” cartridges and advertises on the box and unit that it has enough ink to last up to a year (fine print: when printing only 150 pages per month). There are two versions of the cartridge, the regular which is about 3000 pages and the XL which is double at 6000 pages. I was unable to find a duty cycle rating for this machine. 

The J4535 comes with two paper trays which hold up to 400 sheets. It can handle 8.5x14 paper in either tray; however, legal paper sticks out the front of the machine. There is also a single-sheet feed in the rear of the machine for thicker paper and card stock. Brother says you can use coated or photo paper in the top tray but I prefer to use the single sheet feeder. 

Connecting the machine to my wireless network was quick and easy and installing the software went as expected on both my Windows and Mac computers and laptops. They all found and recognized the printer without incident. The software includes PaperPort SE 14 for document handling. Most of my scanning is to create PDF’s so I use Acrobat rather than the bundled products. I find bundled software like PaperPort cumbersome but generally usable.

Other than the lack of the flip-up document holder, the scanner is the same as my previous model, which is nice, especially if you have it on a shelf with low clearance. There is a flip up catch to stop the scanned documents from running off the top and over the edge. You can also lift up the feeder and use the flat glass to scan items that can't go through the feeder. Scanning is good quality and depending on settings, moves through at a decent pace although I wouldn't consider it high speed and it does not do auto duplexing like the printer does. The software gives you the choice of output including PDF, JPEG, PNG, TEXT, RTF and TIFF. It will also auto-rotate your documents. You can create workflows which save your favorite settings for things like photos and documents. Scanning to email and cloud services like google and dropbox are also supported.

The print quality from the J4535 is acceptable and pretty much the same as my previous Brother MFC machine. Text is readable at 8 points, colors are accurate and shading was smooth both in gray scale and color. I would have liked the black to be a bit darker. Although not as crisp and dark as I would like, I was using standard copy paper and not inkjet specific paper which has a less porous finish and is a bit more expensive. Repeating the same page using a generic glossy photo paper fared even worse than expected. Using photo paper in the media settings - the print took considerably longer and the ink created spots and drops in solid areas. Using the same paper but with regular media selected, the drops in solid areas got even worse. This is clearly not a photo printer. Examples of prints and how the scanner works are included.

There is also a front mounted usb port to print directly from a thumb drive but this seems limited to jpeg files and with the print quality I mentioned, not something I see getting much use.

The printer does have an auto-duplex mode to print on both sides of the page which is very convenient when sending a large print job, however as mentioned above, the scanner is only single sided so it's a no go on double sided copies unless you duplex manually. 

The Brother MFC-J4535 also does faxing but in 2021 I don't know why. Like many people these days I don't have a landline phone line. The fax system seems to be full featured and there if you need it. 

The LCD touch screen is easy to see and the interface makes it easy to use and control all of the device's features. 

Like many printers these days, Brother provides a mobile app that allows you to print and scan to and from your phone. The app works as expected and is great for road warriors that use their phones.

Final thoughts - this machine is plastic and the paper trays and supports are pretty flimsy and need to be used with care. The reason I purchased my first Brother printer was due to it having the least expensive consumables however, after having to purchase new ink cartridges every time I print (which is not that frequently) it might not be such a great deal. It is important to know that even when turned off, this machine, like most other Brother machines, will turn on to perform print head maintenance which drinks ink to keep the nozzles clean. While this is not the first INKvestment printer Brother makes, it is a new design cartridge and I havent found replacements yet. The wireless connectivity is a huge convenience and the mobile app is a nice touch. While it might be possible to refine the print quality by working with the settings and using different paper, I find print quality out of the box with default settings to be a touch disappointing. 

There are three models in this INKvestment lineup so far. Unless you absolutely need multiple paper trays for the convenience of using different paper sizes, I would hesitate to recommend this model but would steer you to the mid-range version. 

If you need dual paper trays because you print that much, an inkjet printer might not be your best investment.",6 months ago
357,358,6461498,allib,5,Good quality printer with lots of features,"This Brother printer has all of the features that we were looking for in an all-in-one printer (print/copy/scan/fax). Set-up is easy and straight forward with the included set-up guide and starter ink cartridges. It’s great that this model includes up to one year of ink in-box based on print volumes of approximately 150 pages a month and 60% black/40% color. High capacity ink cartridges are front-loaded in what Brother calls their Front-Loaded Tank Cartridge Technology which provides easy, convenient access. Two paper trays offer a 400-sheet paper capacity so this is a nice model for small or home business use.

One of the best features offered by today’s printers that include connectivity via Wifi is mobile printing. It is very easy to install the Brother Mobile Connect App to enable one to access features to print documents and photos, scan, copy and maintenance/ink levels. The abililty to print directly from a mobile device such as a phone or tablet is such a nice convenience to have in a printer. The printer is compatible with Windows, Apple AirPrint and Mopria (Android). One can print-from and scan-to cloud services from the printer’s 2.7” color touchscreen. 

Print quality has been great and we’ve found the mobile app convenient and easy to use. The printer build quality seems very good and Brother offers At Your Side support for the life of the printer. Auto-fulfillment of ink is supported through the Refresh by Brother program that delivers ink automatically and just in time to your door. One can also access the Brother Creative Center to customize and print professionally designed home and business templates for free. The printer comes with a one-year warranty.",6 months ago
358,359,6461498,pauldar,5,Home/Office/Family AOI With Numerous Features,"To begin with Brother has been making business technology equipment for over one hundred years. They have proven to be quality-built, dependable, and reliable through these many years. So, I jumped at the chance to review this Brother MFC-J4535DW (AIO) INKvestment Tank Inkjet Printer in exchange for the actual product. Was very interested in the ink-tank printers because they have a larger ink reservoir and hold much more ink then a standard inkjet cartridge. The have proven to last longer between cartridge changes and much more cost effective if you have a larger volume of printing tasks.

Here is why I am impressed with this Brother INKvestment Tank Inkjet Printer:

** SETUP – Pretty easy by following the included 'Quick Setup Guide'. I found the steps indicated in this guide were detailed with helpful illustrations. The ink tank cartridges are front loading and facing, and snap, easily into place. Within 30 minutes I was ready to print. Most of the hardware printer setup can be done on the 2.7 LCD adjustable, touchscreen including the Wi-Fi connection to my router. However, it did take longer to download and install the full driver and software package on my laptop. I also downloaded and installed additional software Brother has available, PaperPort, for my Home-Office document use.

** CONNECTION – I had my choice of a wireless Wi-Fi connection to my home router, USB, or Ethernet direct wired connections. I preferred the Wi-Fi setup to my home network so I could also use my desktop, tablet, phone, and both laptops for printing tasks. Also wanted my Grand Kids to have their mobile devices connected wirelessly since they visit me almost everyday after school, and have homework to print out. Additionally, devices can be connected through Wi-Fi Direct.

** PRINT QUALITY – My home office documents are sharp, professional looking, and easy to read. They can easily be adjusted for more printer options using the 2.7 LCD, on-board touchscreen. The black tank cartridge can produce approximately 2300 pages of printed material. The Red, Blue, and Yellow cartridges can produce approximately 1200 pages of color. Hopefully, that will meet my Grand Kids printing needs for a long time. WooHoo! Color printing is FUN again without the worry of depleting the color cartridges quickly. I printed out several of my Grand Kids end-of-school-photos, and they did quite nicely. However, I do not recommend using glossy photo paper with this tank-ink. Flat or non-glossy photo paper works well.

** ALL IN ONE – This printer allows me to print, copy, scan, and fax. I did not setup the fax. Copies are produced at 1200 x 1200 dpi, and allow me many options like 'fit-to-page', 'base-color-removal', watermark, etc. Copies can also be Reduced/Enlarged 25% - 400% in 1% increments. The auto-document feeder holds up to 20 pages. The scanning function is very fast and duplicates colors accurately. 

** PAPER CAPACITY – Approximately 400 pages using Main Paper Tray and the By-Pass Tray. Both trays will accept up to 8.5"" x 14"" (legal size), Letter, 4x6, 5x8, 3.5x5, 5x7, and A4 and photo paper with borderless printing.

** BROTHER SOFTWARE – I Print & Scan is a great app. It gives me a multitude of options to print out documents, and, or images. Additional software is available like Brother Creative Center, which allows me to create cards, brochures, announcements, etc. from hundreds of stock templates. My Grand Kids want me to explore more of this Creative Center for their own personal FUN. YooHoo!

 In summary this Brother is packed with high-end features found in more expensive printers. This is my ideal Home/Office/Family printer. I have not found my first dislike of this printer.

Over the past years i owned a variety of different printers from major brands and one thing i found annoying was the cartridge life.
Well no more worries with Brother
This printer came with the largest cartridge out the box and after a lot of photo printing that i've done the past few days they are still holding strong. A quality that other brands can't match.
-Quality of document printing is flawless and fast. Fast is also for photo printing but i found necessary to adjust the brightness on some photos in order to reproduce a realistic copy of the original.
-It also has Fax and Scanning functions and they work great either for home or work office.
-Out the box is a very intuitive and easy to connect printer. Had great integration with my apple products and i started to print right away.

361,362,6461498,Mateo,5,versatile and easy to use.,"My work has a copy room with those very large printer machines. The ones that take up the entire wall and cost as much as a new car, so I'm familiar with scanning, printing, and creating large two sided packets. I'm not saying this machine can keep up with that machine, but anything I've needed to produce with that machine this machine can do.

Initial setup was easy and not complicated. The menus make sense and ports, ink tanks, and other need to get to places are easy to get to. This machine doesn't get in your way. 

The top scanner/copier is quiet and accurate. The top feeder is quiet as well. It doesn't look like you can top load too many papers at once. But I made 6 page packets using the top loader without issue. 

The app is easy to use and worked without any glitches or hiccups. Everything you can adjust pre-print from the printer menu can be adjusted in the app. So no need to walk all the way to the printer to adjust settings if you are working from another room.

Now I assume this printer isn't primarily for photo printing but it does a decent job of producing a basic image. The ""best"" quality setting to me only blended the colors better than the normal setting. In document prints there was really no detectable difference between normal and best setting. So use it for pinch image printing but not for text documents.

There really wasn't any issue I ran against when printing and copying on this machine. It's a tremendous blend of quality, functionality, and speed. I definitely have used this for many worksheets color and monochrome. All with faithful color and quality results.",6 months ago
362,363,6461498,KansasMeddlingMom,4,"Hoping for Greatness, But Weary About That","The Brother MFCJ4535DW INKvestment Tank Inkjet Printer for $199.99 is my 3rd INKvestment machine and I am sorry to say that the first 2 were more expensive, the original INKvestment lasting for only 8 months and the refurbished replacement sent to me lasting less than 2 years. Overall, there is a lot to like, but if you enter into this relationship it is my opinion that today's all-in-one printers are basically part of the throwaway society and reconcile yourself to spending an amount that will not make you feel bad if it goes down after the 2 year warranty period, which seems to now be the industry standard versus the prior 1 year one. 

Okay, so now I will get off my soap box and talk specifically about this current model, the MFCJ4535DW. My prior MFC-J995DW XL Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer only had 1 tray and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this model has 2 trays. So, as a CPA office, I have loaded letter-sized paper in tray 1 and legal-sized paper in tray 2. Either of the trays can be converted for the larger paper and they also both will accommodate for envelopes, statements, and all of the various and sundry photo paper sizes. 

Like in the past, Brother printers have an easy peasy setup process that takes you from one task to the other on your computer screen, in addition to the WiFi network setup. As you will see in my pictures, the machine also has an ADF, automatic document feeder, and yet it has a small enough footprint so that I can simply place it on my Origami metal shelf with virtually no vibration. 

The LCD screen is very comfortably read, and trust me when I say that I have huge eye fatigue. You can also print to Dropbox and some other specialty programs quite easily. The online manuals, warranties, drivers, etc. are all located at one site on Brother-just type in the type of equipment and model number.
Make sure that you sign up for your machine's warranty because my experience definitely will require you to call their toll free number for assistance at some point with your ongoing relationship with Brother. 

Again, I will say that my technical support calls were off shored around the world, of which I am certainly no fan of. In this case, if you try to explain that you received this printer as part of Best Buy's Technical Insider Network in exchange for an honest and free review after usage their heads blow up because they do not even know what Best Buy is or that they are a major national U.S. retailer of goods. Oh, by the way, I also downloaded their printing app, in my case from the Google Play store since I have a Samsung smartphone, and it is a gem that never has let me down when I engage it. Thumbs up for now>",6 months ago
363,364,6461498,GadgetGuy1981,4,"Good, but not as economical as other ink systems","The new INKvestment system is great for long-lasting ink storage in the new Brother printers. It is NOT a fair replacement for other competitive ink subscription services and doesn't deliver the same kind of value.

The J4535DW is a GREAT printer - I threw business full-color prints, card stock programs, and photo jobs at this thing and it handled them all beautifully. One of my FAVORITE things about this printer is the sheer capacity of it - Almost an entire ream of paper fits in this thing to not only last for an entire year of ink, but paper as well with no loading at all. 

In MY house, we print about 30-40 pages/month when school is in. In the summer its much less, but photo projects are always kicking around, waiting to take significant percentages of ink. One of my problems with the ink subscription services of the ""other guys"" is that their subscription, while it doesn't LIMIT your ink usage for your page output, they only react to supply you with MORE ink when you run low. I've been able to get around this by calling them and getting a ""spare"" cartridge set on-premises standing by for each of my printers, but this was something I had to ask for and is a lot to manage. 

The INKvestment printer shines as it really holds TONS of ink on-board (Truly close to a 1-year supply) by default, and XL and XXL cartridges can be purchased to really supply up the device.

At the time of this writing, I was unable to find the exact cartridges available online to replace this ink - But going off of what similar Brother tanks cost, I was able to come up with an ""annual cost to operate"" estimate for this printer... Thats where the challenge comes: No matter how cool the ink tank system is, it's going to cost you more to keep 'wet' and supplied than the other guys.

Those ""other"" ink subs start at around $2.99/month for 50 pages. If your house is like mine in 2021 and stays within this limit, you're only paying $36/year no matter how much actual ink you use. That same years' worth of ink (enough to print an entire ream of color pages) is included with the printer but replacing it will likely cost anywhere from $65-90 for both color and black cartridges. It's also important to understand that the ink is tank-based, not full print head cartridge-based, so eventually your print heads will require replacement or maintenance of some kind. One of the advantages of the ""other guys"" who offer ""instant"" ink services, is that their cartridge is head-integrated, so you're putting a new print head inside the machine every time you replace the cartridge. Brother offers the ability to ""auto replenish"" the ink in their program, but it's not discounted nor is there a page-based subscription method, so for most low-volume printing, this just can't compete with the ""instant"" competitors.

Outside of this limitation, and the difference in value on consumables, this is a GREAT printer. Its fast, quiet, and includes a proper paper tray and a great document feeder scanner. The software for scanning and print management is also good, but simple and the UI isn't as advanced as those from EPSON and HP but works well on PC and Mac. I would recommend this device to anyone with a higher yield use case where subscriptions don't make financial sense, as this is a GREAT high-volume device.",6 months ago
364,365,6461498,Ziggy,4,Good for the price point,"For the price this seems to be the only printer in it’s class that has a doc feeder and a Scan to USB port that is not an HP- which I will never buy another one of their products ever again after decades. They have the features but are low quality. Another story. The setup was not awful, good if you have done this before. The print quality is very good, the ink easy to install, the two paper drawers are a nice plus. It is quiet and fast. A few things that are a bit off for a modern printer- the fax and scan settings are a bit complicated and you can’t name a scan before scanning TMK. Also, and this is really odd, the feeder feeds face side DOWN, and shoots the fed doc back under the docs to be fed, creating a bit of a paper jumble. So don’t leave it alone while doc feeding! And why can’t anyone makes a tray for copies long enough these days to hold more than 10 docs! For all that it is still good enough and had the features I wanted that I bought a second one for another location. Better than average.",3 months ago
365,366,6461498,TomC,5,Money well spent,"A reasonable price for a two tray, duplex printer. Extremely quiet and fast. Being an All-in-One makes it that much better. If the ink lasts as long as they say, even better. 

Only complaint and it's minor is they don't show you that you need to open the unit to install the standard usb printer cable and/or the network cable which should be done before turning the unit on. If you go online you find this out but it should be shown in the start up instructions. 

Overall a great product.",3 months ago
366,367,6461498,Rudy,5,Performs well for the price. Save on ink.,"Print quality and speed, and the promise of at least a 1400 black ink page yield. It has a fancy startup and shut down tone for a printer. It was a little surprising, but welcome compared to the thing just beeping. The touch screen is not too small for my big hands. I've had issues with Epson screens and fat fingering because the screen and buttons were too small. I got rid of my aging Epson in favor of an ink tank type printer, to save money on ink spent per year. I love that it holds a lot of paper. Setup was super easy and after printing the first alignment sheet, it asked me to put it on the scanner bed and adjusted itself. Has fax (won't be using that), and a hidden usb and ethernet connection. However, my only gripe is the color options. There are none. The computer, photo printer in my home office is black/gray/silver. This sticks out. I wish there was a black option. I opted for the Brother over the Epson Ecotank for cost reasons. The Brother got better reviews and costs significantly less.",3 months ago
367,368,6461498,BrotherBoy,5,Great product with easy setup,"Set up took less than 15 minutes from start to finish (wireless - including opening the box). This really was a snap. Print quality is excellent but I have not (and will not) do any photo printing and print speed was much faster than I expected. I do, however, take issue with the product being advertised as INKvestment since a full complement of cartridges is around $100 and, despite the fact that the product description clearly indicates ""1-Year of ink in-box"", the cartridges are obviously starter cartridges. So, plan on adding ~$100 to the purchase price so you ACTUALLY get a year's worth of ink.",1 month ago
368,369,6461498,pinkoos,4,"Inkjet takes getting used to, some design issues","Coming mainly from a laser printer the last few years, using an inkjet takes some getting used to, but that is not really an issue with this particular model, rather for all inkjets in general

Getting a printer on my network easily is one of the most important things for me and this Brother performed flawlessly in that department, as had my previous Brothers

This inkjet prints fast, so I definitely like that about it
I also like the ability to print via email, though this feature is buried either in the user manual or the web config page - one would not even know about it without doing some snooping; however, once set up, it works nicely

There is a design decision I question, though - in all my previous Brothers (and other brands that I’ve owned), the USB and ethernet ports are conveniently placed either on the side or back of the printer, easily within reach of the respective cords

However, in this model, for some odd reason that eludes me these ports are inside the printer, only accessible by raising the scanning glass portion of the printer and, even then, only after threading the cords through a conduit to get to the ports. Why Brother did this I have no idea, but it was definitely an annoyance for me as I had to get a longer ethernet cable than the one I had used on my previous Brother which this printer is replacing

So, keep that in mind when making a decision to purchase this printer or not - it may be worth downloading the full instruction manual prior to purchase and perusing through it so you’re not caught off guard by any other ‘features’ that are different from the standards one is used to",6 months ago

373,374,6454283,HoMi3,4,Simply works,"I feel like HP is going for the crowd that wants to have a printer and scanner that works good for the few times you need to either print or scan a document. 

In the box, you get the color ink cartridge, black ink cartridge, power cable, and the printer. They include a ""Get Started"" instruction sheet which pretty much says to turn the printer on and install the HP Smart app in your app store and follow the instructions within the app to setup the printer for the first time. 

Setup was simple. It took me just a few minutes to download the app, hook up the printer, setup the printer, and print the test sheet. I even printed out a colored photo (on regular paper) to see the quality in the details that this printer has. I was not disappointed in it, again since it was on standard paper and not photo paper but even when I scanned the same printed copy into the scanner, it still reflected a good scan overall. Scanning just dulled some of the color but when scanning documents it did so pretty well. 

Within the HP Smart app I recommend you get familiar with the tiles that are similar to how Windows 10 has some tiles for their apps. I recommend you go into your printer's ""advanced settings"" to get access to web services and network settings. 

Some of the good things I like:
-App's ease of use
-WiFi Direct
 -Airprint
-Google Cloud Print
-Style

Not to my liking:
-Some difficulty in opening up paper feeder tray and ink cartridge bay. 
-Scanning quality could be better",1 year ago
374,375,6454283,Phjilek36,4,All-in-One For everyone,"The printer was not every easy to connect to my network. For some reason, the wifi was not recognizing the printer in our office. I had to reboot the machine several times by unplugging and pugging it back in, then rebooting my laptop as well. I even tried to press the WPS button on the router, but that was not working.

The printer registration is required to print anything. I don't like that I have to register it with the 6 months free ink plan before I can even try it out. Yes, it is free to try, but I still have to provide my information to print anything. There could be some benefit for those who print a decent amount each month, where they would save money in the long run, than buying ink on their own. I don't go through a lot of ink in any given month at home, but for the office, I print every couple days. It also comes with an additional 1 year warranty when registered and set up in the ""Advanced HP + Smart app.""

This is really not meant for a multi-user office, because in order to print, you need to have an HP account. When it is installed on another computer, that too has to be registered. So if it is on my own child's computer, I can login with my account, but if it is for other people, such as an office, then each person needs to register, which I feel is a bit intrusive. 

The scanning is pretty quick. I like that I can just get an instant copy color/b&w with the push of a button. I can save scans to the cloud, as well as print from the cloud. The mobile app scanning feature is pretty slick. I can take a photo scan of something on my phone and print it to my HP printer. That is a great feature. The printing is not borderless, which I wish it were. 

The tray is a little hard to pull out, and not feel like I am going to break it. But for the most part, I would leave it open, sitting on my desk. The top document feeder scanner is a good feature to have, because if I want to scan more than 1 page at a time, the feeder is a must. 

The printer connects with a dual-band WiFi, and self reset. That basically means that when there is an issue with the wifi signal, or it disconnects, it will reset itself and reconnect. My old printer would fail when my router reset, and I had to reconnect manually, so this feature is pretty nice. I am not sure how common that is with all printers. The 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz capability is nice, because the 2.4 network is getting pretty clogged these days.

I can send a secure mobile fax from the HP app. I never really need to do that, but something nice to know I can.

The speed of printing, for an inkjet printer, is really pretty fast. 5.5 pages per minute for color. The printer resolution is 4800x1200, but the copy directly quality is only 300x300. That works for standard text, but for anything else beyond that, it is pretty bleak. I am not sure why that was a limitation, but that seems like a miss to me. That alone removed a star from my rating.",4 months ago
375,376,6454283,stevefromtheburbs,4,"Great product, a few glitches, but overall great","HP always releases decent products, and this is no exception. This isn't a cheaply made printer by any means, it was well designed, packaged, and it works really well, once you get it setup. 

The glitches had to do with the setup. What was supposed to happen did not. The app could not find the printer when using the WIFI setup, and could not find the network despite there being the 2.4GHZ needed for this printer. Locally, WIFI direct, was no problem. So, this was an app glitch. In going through the app, I found the network setup, which links you to a web page, which allowed me to get in and input the WIFI network settings into the printer. Then it worked fine. But to expect a non-tech type to do this is not reasonable and would have resulted in a tech support call, and probably a lengthy one to get through it all. This could have been avoided by more beta testing of app and its functions. My WIFI is broadcasting both 2.4 and 5GHZ signals, so that should not have been the holdup to completing the install. My WIFI is nothing special, so it wasn't my network. 

Now, print quality is amazing, in HP tradition. The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) worked great, no multi-page mistakes. The scanning is very clear and crisp. There is a 2 year subscription to faxing as well, so you can scan and fax to a fax machine, for those times you are required to fax something - saves a trip to Staples or whatever to fax something.

My only other concern about this is the cost of ink replacements. In a move to get printers to come with plenty of ink, this comes with the standard yield cartridges and 2 free months of ink. I don't know how much a printer this size will use in 2 months, but seems like maybe the 2 free months isn't really going to be much of a help. I'd like to see high yield cartridges included and the price to be more amenable to the wallet - sometimes buying new cartridges is more expensive than buying a new printer. 

So it isn't a secret, I use my printer to print shipping/return labels for things, more than anything else. My wife prints the bank statements and keeps them for awhile. Or the kids print some things for college. These things were all great. I don't print many photos, but a test photo did turn out to be very high quality using photo paper and the standard ink that comes with it. 

Is this a quality printer that will last for quite some time? Yes, I know it will, their products always do. Will it be the most cost effective solution? Maybe or maybe not, but it is reliable, it will last a very long time, and you won't be cursing when trying to print your boarding pass at 4am for a flight and your printer won't work - that kind of thing. HP stuff works, works well, and this is no exception. Just wish the app hadn't been temperamental and we'd have been at 5 stars.",1 year ago
376,377,6454283,hitsuyoo,3,The Cost Of Printing,"I'm going to just state that, for all intents & purposes, this printer works really well. Wireless printing is a breeze. Scanning is to my computer is a snap and the Hp app is easy to use. The printer comes with 2 HP 67 ink cartridges( one black & one color) and a power cord. Just add power, paper & a dash of internet and you've got yourself a printing party. It can print up to 35 pages at once with the paper being fed from the back and documents being fed through the top tray or one at time , being placed on the scanner. It works great with my phone and PCs, so there's no problem with that. All this in a light weight package for the affordable price $99.99 USD. Now the real problem is the way HP wants you to subscribe to their ink renewal plan( instant ink program) You pay a monthly fee of $0.99 or upwards of $24.99, a month, for this service, depending on how much you print and judging from the size of the ink cartridges, you'll either be getting a steal of a deal or getting robbed blind. It is a cool idea, but the jury is still out on that one. Basically the printer is fair at best, but the ink will not last very long at all. So, that's where they'll get you.

My old one was a ""most-in-one"" whereas this one truly does everything you need in a printer.
I was happy to see that most if not all packaging is recyclable, thanks HP for not using Styrofoam.
The printer itself came completely sealed in plastic wrap, giving you a peace of mind that no one has touched the printer since it was manufactured. This is the first time I've seen a printer packaged like that.
Inside the box, there is a power cord, 2 ink cartridges and an assortment of literature like the setup guide and an insert about the Instant Ink promotion.

The manufacturer recommends applying a tad bit of school glue stick to the print bed, I use hairspray instead (read it on another website) and it works much better, in my opinion. I just use a piece of paper to cover up the fan, extruded, and other moving parts. 
I have already ordered $300+ worth of material and supplies from XYZ’z website. 
I like their printing software, mobile compatibility, print time, noise level, and so on. 
I did find one minor flaw with the printer’s mobile printing capabilities. I found that on iOS the XYZprint HUB does not work to print, for me, instead I use the XYZgallery app. 
Also, the XYZgallery (online and in the application) is useless, it essentially doesn’t work. Use Thingiverse, they have just about anything you can think of!",10 months ago

When buying a 3D printer is important to do your homework and buy one that suits your needs. The price of this one is very good and good quality prints.

Granted, I'm a newbie to the 3D printing scene so I might be easy to impress. Got a couple of pretty decent prints after the first dud didn't stick to the bed. If your room is cool you'll want to liberally apply glue stick to the bed to make sure the bottom of what you are printing sticks. There was some trial and error figuring things out as the manual is pretty skimpy. Plus the one included in the box had screen shots that were from older XYZ software and did not match at all with the current version. I did find a more current manual online and was able to download it.

My disappointment wasn't with the print output but rather the fact that I could not get the WiFi to connect. I exchanged a bunch of information with XYZ support and sat through a couple of remote troubleshooting sessions with them when the finally gave up and concluded the problem might be a faulty wireless module in the printer. So, I ended up returning the unit and purchasing a different model.",8 months ago

413,414,6473925,ReviewedByPhil,5,"Compact, prints w/bright colors & sharp detail","While the HP Sprocket Studio is not the first dye sublimation photo printer that I’ve used, it’s the first one that I’ve owned that prints full-size 4x6 photo prints. Even so, this printer still manages to have a pretty small form-factor and has a footprint smaller than a sheet of printer paper (10.5”L x 6.75”W x 2.5”H). The paper tray is even detachable, making it even more compact for travel, and there is an option to use a portable battery unit with it (sold separately).

For setup, simply load the included paper and cartridge, download the HP Sprocket mobile app, and pair the printer via Bluetooth to an Android or iOS mobile device. The whole process takes about 5 minutes. However, if you’re looking to print photos from a computer, unfortunately the Sprocket Studio does not support this type of connectivity.

Using the app for straight up printing is fairly easy. You can select photos from your phone’s camera gallery, connect various social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, or Google Photos, and print pictures directly from those services. However, for anything beyond that, the experience was a bit more frustrating. For me, app navigation was initially confusing with ambiguous icons for the various tools and no helpful hover hints at their function. The photo editor itself had some major hiccups. For example, if you added stickers, text, and filters to your image, but subsequently tried to add a pre-set overlay template, it would wipe out all your previous additions and changes, but not vice versa. Also, it wasn’t easy to distinguish when you were committing just the most recent edit or all edits in your session; with the former you could use the undo button to back out of the change, but with the latter, undo isn’t available and you would have to discard your draft and start all over again.

After editing your photo you can print it, of course, but also save or share directly to online storage accounts and social media. There are also a few of other fun and useful photo modes in the app like photobooth for a quick succession of 4 photos, a tiles print mode that lets you assemble 9 prints into a single larger image, and ‘ID card’ which allows you to quickly and easily snap and print a set of 2x2 inch passport photos at home.
 
As for the printing process itself, it was quick and straightforward. Once you have an image edited, cropped, positioned, and sized how you want it, tap the printer icon in the app, and the image will be sent to the printer queue, which takes roughly 35 seconds. After the printer receives the data, it starts printing immediately, though a single print takes about 2 minutes to complete. During this time the paper passes in and out of the printer, from both the front and back of the unit, so be sure to leave at least 5 inches behind the machine clear as to not interfere with the paper. Other print jobs waiting in the queue can be deleted from the queue via the app while a photo is printing. Also, keep in mind the printer can only fit 10 photo sheets at a time, so you’ll have to reload the tray after every 10 prints.

One feature that I was very interested to try was the augmented reality Reveal, which is supposed to invisibly watermark your photo, then bring up additional content like location data and related photos and videos when the print is scanned by the app later. Although I turned on the Reveal feature for several of my prints, and the app indicated Reveal content was being added prior to printing, subsequent scanning of my prints revealed… well nothing. The app simply said “No Reveal content found,” however, it did correctly recognize the printer itself and would show the next photo in its queue floating above the machine, which I thought was pretty neat.

The quality of the prints is very good. I found the colors to be bright, though perhaps slightly undersaturated and on the cooler side than what I saw on my mobile device. The details in the prints were pretty sharp. If you looked closely enough at fine lines, you might see a bit of a soft edge, but not enough that I would consider the print quality compromised. The color range is actually quite impressive for such a small printer that doesn’t use any ink, which also allows you to go long stretches between printing and not have to worry about dried up or clogged ink cartridges. Printing at home with the Sprocket Studio won’t get you the lowest price per print, but for the convenience of printing at home and having the prints ready in-hand in just a few minutes, might be worth the extra few cents. 

Overall, the HP Sprocket Studio delivers high-quality, full-sized, glossy photo prints that are durable and at a reasonable cost. While you're limited to mobile device connectivity, and the app could use a few tweaks, the zero ink cartridges mean you can print as frequently or infrequently as you need and not worry about the hassles ink. Prints come off the machine quickly, and the unit is small enough to keep on your desk or travel with for on-the-go printing.",2 years ago
414,415,6473925,pauldar,5,Snap It On Your Phone – Print It A Minute Later,"After going through several highly touted photo printers only to be disappointed by the expensive costs of ink cartridges, photo paper, and not so great color, photo reproduction. I was intrigued reading about this HP Sprocket Studio Printer and the superior color of its printed photos. So when I had an opportunity to select this Sprocket Studio for an honest review in exchange for the printer I was anxious to evaluate it on quality of photos and costs. I am a Grandfather with six photogenic Grand Kids, and I take tons of photos. This Sprocket Studio Printer has an easy learning curve and the more I use it, the more I find all the innovative ways to enhance my photo treasures. After a week of using this little baby to print out some of my most favorite photos – I am thoroughly impressed:

** Quality Of Photos – This is the most important reason for purchasing a photo printer in the first place. As I unboxed this unit I was very skeptical of its size, weight, and build to make quality, brilliant color photos at its price point. However, I soon realized that this HP Sprocket Studio prints out magnificent, 4” x 6” (102 x 152 mm) full-spectrum, detailed photos in vivid color. It is absolutely awesome how a little printer like this Sprocket Studio can produce such photo realism and color splendor given its small size and simplicity. When I select a photo to print on my phone I access this printer through the HP Sprocket App. The Sprocket Studio Printer then draws a 4' x 6” photo paper from the photo-paper housing into the front printer slot. The photo paper slides back and forth from front to the back of the printer until the final, finished print is gently placed onto the top of the photo paper housing. The printed photo actually develops in front of my own eyes through the Sprocket Printer process – Amazing! The finished photo exceeds my expectations for color elegance and superior quality. Yipee!

** Photo Paper – What really makes this Sprocket Printer unique is that the available photo paper prints out beautiful, colored photos that HP claims will last 100 years, durable, and are resistant from fading, too. WoW! From HP - “Tests conducted by Wilhelm Imaging Research, Inc. indicate that photos printed with Original HP inks on HP Advanced Photo Paper Glossy are rated for longer than 100 years in dark storage.” Also from HP - “Durable: Using Original HP inks with HP Advanced Photo Paper and HP Premium Plus Photo Paper enables your photos to withstand rain and water spills, and dry quickly, so you can share them immediately without the fear of smudging or smearing.” Astonishing! The photo paper housing of this Sprocket Studio has a maximum capacity of 20 sheets. That is a lot of printer photos before I have to reload. Since I plan to use this FUN printer an awful lot these coming holidays, I purchased Two, HP, Sprocket Studio 2-Pack Standard Capacity with Color Ink Cartridges + Photo Paper (80 sheets each) from my local Best Buy (see pics). I now have up to 160 photos I can print out and share with my family and friends at our celebrations. WooHoo!

** Cost Per Photo – Replacement photo paper and cartridges average out to approximately $.43 cents per a generously-sized, 4” x 6” photo. Considering the outstanding color photo caliber, this HP Sprocket Studio Photo Paper is a bargain. 

** Bluetooth Connectivity - HP Sprocket uses 5.0 Bluetooth technology. It is so easy to connect and pair. And, I can pair up to three of my separate devices in its registry. However to be able to utilize the Sprocket App on another device I have to unpair from the device I am currently connected too. When my Sprocket Studio is powered OFF, I have to re-select pairing again in my BT settings on my cell phone to take advantage of the Sprocket App.

** HP Sprocket App – Here is where the FUN begins. This Free App can be downloaded at the Apple or Google Play Stores. It was easy to install and set-up my Studio Sprocket Printer. The App prompted me through the process. It provides exciting enhancements to photos from my existing gallery, allows me to take and also edit photos, add embedded contents using 'Reveal', and print my photos using the Sprocket Studio Printer. At the Home Screen of this App I can sign-in to any of my popular Social Services by swiping to the Left of the screen, which allows me to access my social media account photos. Pretty Neat! Photos cannot be printed manually, you must use this Sprocket App from your phone. Be aware for all these App features to work 'Permissions' must be given to access your photo gallery, location, and camera and microphone. The Sprocket App will request them the first time App is launched. What can I do that is so special with this App?

By clicking on the Pencil Icon in the right-hand corner of my selected and previewed photo I open up a host of editing features:
* Auto-Fix; Adjustments for Brightness, Contrast, Saturation & Reset. 
* Filters for various Lighting Effects I choose to set a mood or atmosphere.
* Quick Action Edits, which add pre-created artwork for Happy Birthday, Congratulation, etc.
* Frames with seasonal touches, Birthday & Congratulations , and decorative borders.
* Numerous FUN Stickers and Banners for almost every occasion. 
* Text, which allows me to personalize my pics with my own words (see attached fishing pic). 
* Brush, which can add colors and shades of colors to my photos.
* Crop/Rotate, which allows me to edit my photos any way I so choose.

** Additional App Features – In Print Preview I can swipe to Tiles, which is pretty unique. Even though each printed photo size is 4” x 6” I can use any one of my favorite photos and create an 8” x 12” tiled photo by selecting the four-tile icon, or, create a 12” x 18” tiled photo selecting the nine-tile icon. How cool is that? Photos in the Queue can always be deleted if I change my mind to not print them, or, add enhancements, stickers, and texts, etc.

** Take It Anywhere – HP Sprocket Studio Printer is approximately 6.65” W x 10.75” D x 2.68” H in) and weighs approximately 2.06 pounds. It has a small footprint and is lightweight so I can take it anywhere. It uses 120V power and has a three-pronged grounding electrical plug. There is an optional Power Bank available for sale at my local Best Buy, which has enough power to allow for up to 80 photos to be printed. It is ON my 'to-buy' list. It can even re-charge my cell phone with its built in USB Port. This little baby can be the 'life' of a party, at family events, or any group get-together. My teenage nephew would love to have this Sprocket to take to his friends' Birthday Party, Tailgating, and informal meet-ups with his circle of friends.

** Summary – I love this little HP Sprocket Studio Printer. It takes great photos of my Grand Kids and family, but more important for me and Grandma it creates fantastic, visual memories. YooHoo! It is a great replacement for those 'Instant Cameras', because the prints last almost indefinitely, take a little moisture, and are smear resistant. The printer is not expensive, nor are the cartridges, and photo papers. I highly recommend the purchase of 
this HP Sprocket Studio Printer. You won't be disappointed.",2 years ago
415,416,6473925,Robsapremiresilver,4,Great Product,"The review of the HP Sprocket Studio. This is the first time I have reviewed a product like this. Besides the obvious limitations, such as only printing out 4x6 size prints, which is great for scrapbooking the product is quite nice to have. The quality of the prints are outstanding, and the technology is groundbreaking. the product is quite nice to have. 

Pros:
• A Small Footprint for the printer which doesn’t take much space at all. Its is also easy to pack up and take on trips.
• In-expensive Paper and Cartridges. At the time of this review, you could buy 80 sheets of paper and Ink Cartridges for $34.99
• Special paper is smudge-proof, water-resistant, tear-resistant fade-resistant, glossy color photos that can last for 100 years.
• Easy to connect to phone or Pad for wireless printing from the app.
• App has pre-installed Photo Lab allows you to personalize your photos straight from your phone or tablet with a simple edit function within the app.
• Allows you to share your photo creations on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and Google.

Cons:
• Just the Paper size.

416,417,6473925,Bren,4,"Great prints and looks, phone app needs work","When i got this photo printer I was very excited! It is compact, looks aesthetically pleasing, and the prints it yields are actually of fantastic quality for being churned out in about a minute or so. Upon initial set up, I was able to get up and connected very quickly on my phone using the user friendly software. In no time at all I had printed out some pictures on the included photo paper and I was happily surprised by how nice the prints turned out! The loss of the star on this review though comes from the fact that when I returned to come back to print more photos the next day, I could NOT get connected back to the printer through my phone despite following all of the HP troubleshooting guides online. I am sure they will tweak this bug out and it still works with my computer, so I am not giving up on the printer or telling anyone not to buy it. The prints are great and software can always be improved.",2 years ago
417,418,6473925,TheOffice1234,5,Great for Must Have Instant “Real” Prints.,"REVIEW HP SPROCKET STUDIO
Best Buy Tech Insider Network Review Program

SUMMARY: Great for Must Have Instant “Real” Prints. Table must be 2X length of Printer.

UNBOXING IMPRESSION:
Easy to unbox, simple packaging. For the most part it is already assembled just install the paper and dye cartridge. The only very minor complaint I had was that there are no included instructions, but I guess that goes with the minimalist packaging, so it was not a big deal. Like most HP products you only get a starter set of supplies (10 prints). For the price I would have appreciated a full cartridge.

EASE OF USE:
It was easy to go to the URL included in the packaging to load the app on the phone and follow the step by step instructions. I then gave the app permission to view my photos on the phone and I selected one to print.

TIP: Make sure you have enough room on your table that is twice the length of the printer. The photo paper moves out the back and then gets pulled back in, multiple times in the printing process. At first, I kept getting errors. It turned out that because I had it on the edge desk, once it pushed the paper out the back (with the paper hanging over the edge), it did not have enough strength to pull the paper back in again. I was about to call tech support when I decided to put it in the center of the desk, so that the paper was fully supported on the way out/back in. If the mechanism is so weak, they really should have a support tray in the back. 

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
I was skeptical that something so small could really deliver a quality 4x6 photo grade prints.
Now, I am convinced, as it works very well.
We used it to make Passport Photos, without any problems, or the hassle of finding a place to make them and driving there waiting in line etc.
It prints rather quickly (much faster than an ink jet), and I would call these photo grade prints no problem.
The price per print (about 50 cents) is certainly more than the corner store (7 cents). But if you are only printing a few prints then this is of course cheaper than driving to the store and back.

The APP is only OK. I’ve not explored the app in depth, but I was not able to find a simple crop command for example. It just means that I have to edit my pics on the phone before selecting them on the app. Maybe there is a crop somewhere, but it did not jump out at me. Pressing EDIT only allowed for simple color correction for example.

CONCLUSION:
It is the best I have seen for quality due to dye sublimation technology. It is relatively compact, and I could see this being used at parties or when you just want a quick print to give to the grandparents or maybe even instant security badges.
I would recommend this for occasional uses as mentioned above. If I had a bunch of prints to make, then I would just upload them to my local photo processor and pick them up there.",2 years ago
418,419,6473925,Steveo,1,Broke in 5 minutes,"Complete junk, printed one picture and now every time I go to print it says “ replace printer cartridge”. Three new cartridges and still the same red light and no pictures. Reached out to HP and revived no response. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1 year ago
419,420,6473925,APFLORES413,4,Takes too long to print,"I was initially thrilled with this printer. I don’t like printing Photos with my ink jet printers and I feel that office stores charge too much. I had a lot of hours with this HP Sprocket but was disappointed. 

Pros:
-Compact Size. The printer itself is about 7 in long but the paper tray adds another 7 inches to accommodate the photo paper. Despite this, I really like the compact nature HP has designed. 
-Quiet: the sounds of the Sprocket printing is really quiet, just how I like it. 
-Setup: downloading the app and connecting the Sprocket was too simple. 

Cons:
-Takes too long: from pressing print on the app, it took 1:38 to print. The photo paper is fed several times back and forth as it prints the varying ink colors on before you receive the final product. I feel that is way too slow. 
-Quality: I was not impressed with the picture quality. The photos print out too dark and grainy. 
-Lack of Portability. You are limited by the power cord. I portable battery would’ve been ideal here. 
-Not enough photo paper in the box. You are given 10 photo paper to start. I felt maybe doubling that would have been better. 

Overall i was not really impressed with this printer. Yes it prints directly onto 4x6 paper but for me, there was so much left desiring.",2 years ago

423,424,6473925,Lenlen,5,Love this tiny photo printer,"I have the original sprocket, while I was already impressed by the photo quality, I wasn’t a fan of small printed photos since I don’t do scrapbooks. I am more into photo albums. Needless to say I was ecstatic when HP released this Sprocket Studio which prints 4x6 photos. The performance of this tiny printer goes hand in hand with the performance of the HP Sprocket app. Installing the printer is a breeze and the app gives you step by step instructions which are easy to follow. Once the printer is connected with the app, you just select any photos from your gallery (you have to allow access to your gallery or you can also take photos directly through the app). You can edit - add texts, stickers, borders, change filters - the photo via the app. The app has variety of design options, I was tempted to try each one of them! I love the stickers feature which also has milestones stickers I can use for my baby’s photos. From the time I clicked the print button, it took about 73 seconds to finish printing one photo. The photo quality is great, sharp and the colors are balanced. Obviously you can edit your photos through the app to make it more appealing. The printer came with a cartridge and 10 photo papers. I haven’t printed a lot so I am not sure how long the cartridge will run out of ink before you have to buy a new one. For the price I wished it comes with more photo papers though. But all in all I’m highly satisfied with this tiny photo printer and will recommend.",2 years ago
424,425,6473925,Moons,5,Pleased,Love this printer. Took me a bit to figure it out but overall easy. I did learn I had to disconnect my sprocket inorder to use it so I have to repair them each time I want to use the other but it's super easy.,5 months ago
425,426,6473925,eclafitz,4,"Decent little printer, great for vacations","Wish I went bigger, that's what everyone probably says. It does the job. Buyer beware, it only takes HP paper and ink. Can be a bit of a hassle.  I also haven't looked into cheaper ink options, probably not worth it with the tech these days. There are no shortcuts around quality.",1 year ago
426,427,6473925,OmieOne,5,Nice to Print Custom 4x6,"This is a great little device for printing 4x6 photos at home. Since this is a dye sublimation printer it looks like you are printing a photo. In my testing I've done a few of my kids professional school photo's and I can't really tell the difference between what the printer printed and the photo's unless I look really close. But in a picture frame, or hanging on a wall its great. So if you want to print custom 4x6 photo's of yourself, friends and family this is great. It does its job, and does it fairly fast though an app on your Phone/tablet Android/iOS device.

*********SETUP************
You install the application on your phone/tablet, in my case an Android Phone and it walks you through getting this setup. That was fairly simple in getting the paper and printer cartridge in. Note that when setting up via the app you have to acknowledge the terms and services, if you don't want the app tracking your usage make sure to click the links and turn the data collection off. HP could have made it more obvious, but at least you can turn it off during installation and setup.
Out of the box it only comes with ten sheets, so if you are like me, pick up some additional paper (which will come with the cartridge too) while you are at Best Buy to save yourself a trip after you go through the starter pack fairly quickly having too much fun. That said the App setup was easy, since it uses Bluetooth, it paired quickly on Android 10 and I was able to start printing fast. It even lets you name the device and pick a power led color which is a nice touch. They do have an AR portion of the App that will show you things if you scan the lid of the printer. Honestly for me, it wasn't necessary, but some people may have fun with it and it is always possible that over time they will add a bunch of additional features, so its nice that it is there.

****USAGE*****
The app has a lot of features to customize, and if you are younger I can see the appeal, me I just wanted to print my photo's. It can see your local albums on the phone (Assuming you gave it permission), FB, Insta and Google. I hope they add the ability to add other cloud providers like DropBox and OneDrive where I actually have most of my pictures backed up. That said, it was easy enough for me to go into OneDrive, pick a few pictures download them to my phone and start printing. Again the app does have the ability to modify the picture add stickers, a border and text before you print allowing you to customize it. Once your are done, hit print in the app and wait (takes about a minute or so) and its very interesting to watch it print since it goes in and out a few times as it lays down the different colors. Once its done out pops a dry awesome looking print of your photo in 4x6 size ready to hang on a wall. Printing for me took about a minute or so. Honestly didn't time it, but it wasn't that long at all.
I've had a lot of fun printing pictures out with this and can see at family gathering where this will be a hit since we can get awesome prints right there, esp. since it isn't that large and doesn't take up a lot of space (Do make sure though you keep about 5 inches clear in back since the way it prints out the photo you need that space in the back for the paper to stick out).
HP has a great product here, with wonderful quality prints that is easy to setup and print from your phone of tablet, and if your like me and love sharing photo's at Family gatherings to have physical memento's then this really is the device for you.",2 years ago
427,428,6473925,Nerdninja,4,"Good Prints, Small Learning Curve","I'll get the obvious stuff out of the way first: The Sprocket Studio produces excellent, sharp and vibrant 4x6 prints in less than a minute from your phone or table with very little effort. As a photo printer, I couldn't be more happy with the results. I also own one of the smaller Sprocket printers, and these prints are much better quality, and of course, much larger. The size comes at the expense of portability, as this printer needs to be plugged in and is a little awkward to throw in a bag.

My main complaint is the setup process. There were no real directions other than to download the mobile app and let it guide you through setup. Simple enough, it would seem, but it took me a few moments to figure out where to get started in the app.

If you're planning a space for the printer, keep in mind that you will need about 5"" open space behind the printer. The paper makes four passes as each layer of color is produced, so the print moves in and out several times and needs some clearance in the back.

My other complaint is that the starter ribbon and paper pack is only good for 10 prints. I get that the business model is to get you to keep coming back for paper, but 10 prints out of the box seems pretty stingy. Plan to buy a refill when you get the printer!",2 years ago

Every other photo, there’s a black line on the bottom inch of the photo. I have gone through 2 printers and it is still happening. Couldn’t stand it. I returned them both.",1 year ago
431,432,6473925,niteryder,4,"Pretty good, but could be better","After a few days and several photos printed, I like this printer, but the photo quality is just not as good as I would like.
As for the printer quality and set up, it was very easy. Just download the app and follow the directions. Put in the cartridge and paper and just that fast you are ready to print. The printer seems well made an durable enough to take whatever you throw at it. 
I've had two HP photo printers in the past, both used ink cartridges and both put out incredible 4 x 6 prints. I also have had two Sub Dye printers and in both the quality was lacking. This HP uses a Sub Dye cartridge in this printer and the crispness just isn't there. The other thing I noticed, is from the time you start to print, to the end, it takes 1 minute and 53 seconds. This is not a negative, but just an observation. Every print took this much time to print so I assume this is normal.
Neither of these are cause not to purchase this printer. It does exactly what it is advertised to do, it makes 4 x 6 prints and they are good enough to show to friends, family or put in a photo album.
The only thing I see as a negative is, this is a portable printer, but this version has no battery or case. Those items have to be purchased separately, or you can get a kit for $199, which includes printer, battery and carry case. If purchased seperately it would run $89.00 for the battery, $49.00 for the case, and $149 for the printer. So if you want a true portable printer, you would be better off getting the kit for $50 more. Really, having a portable printer with no battery and no way to carry it defeats the purpose of a portable printer. 
In conclusion, this printer is good for making 4x6 prints for everyday use, if you do not need portability, this is a great option.",2 years ago

433,434,6470012,Posted1,5,Excellent Printer,"Excellent printer. I mean, that really does sum it up. Not only does it do a great job printing, but it saves sssooooo much money in ink cartridges. According to Business Insider, printer ink in cartridge format costs considerably more than human blood. How crazy is that?

Each ink bottle is the equivalent of 90 ink cartridges. I don't know about you, but I always lamented running low on ink and the thought or dropping $35 to $55 for three or four replacement cartridges. In some cases, it almost made more sense to buy a new printer and just toss the old one. Multiply that by 90 and yeah, that is a LOT of $$$$. On Epson's website, you can buy all 4 replacement cartridges for less than $60 and I'm sure if you shopped wisely, you will find it for less. I'll let you do the math, but yes, that is HUGE savings.

While it's hard to tell specific cost savings because everyone uses the printers differently, I do have some experience with the Epson EcoTank platform (picture attached) because I have had the Epson EcoTank 3760. I have had it since July 2020. I ran a diag on it today... since then, I have printed 365 pages of which 99 were in color. As you can see from the picture (ET-3760), the black has barely used 1/4 tank and the 3 color tanks have barely moved. Again, think of the savings.

The Epson EcoTank offers a clean app for printing from phone and is simple to set up as a network printer. As mentioned, we have two EcoTank printers on our network and setup and choosing which printer to use is super-easy. 

Set up was simple, but not particularly quick and I am perfectly OK with that. Each tank took between 2 to 2.5 minutes to fill. Well worth it considering the savings. Connecting to network was a breeze. Tuning the ink jets was also a little time consuming but completely worth it given the savings.

We also have a couple printers that offer ""subscription"" cartridge services and I absolutely attest that this EcoTank environment is much preferred both for convenience and for money savings. 

End of the day, I RARELY give 5 stars, but for the Epson EcoTank 3830, I am honestly having a hard tome finding faults. Excellent choice.

I would (and HAVE) recommend to friends without any hesitation. I end where I started... Excellent printer.

434,435,6470012,James,5,Small Form Factor And Ink Efficient,"The Epson ET-3830 is a multi-function inject printer with a small form factor. A change from the norm is that this printer doesn’t use ink cartridges. It has tanks inside the printer that you refill. The refills are bottles of ink. Each bottle contains far more ink than the traditional ink cartridge. Filling the internal tanks using the bottles is simple to do. Also, while filling the tanks I didn’t have any mess or leaks from the bottles. This is a nice design by Epson. I should be saving quite a lot compared to traditional ink cartridges. The set of starter bottles of ink that come with the printer are full bottles. When you initially setup the printer, it will fill tubes with some of the ink. After it filled the tubes, I was left with a little over 75% of ink in the tanks. Using the remaining ink from each bottle, the tanks ended up with 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow. The black tank was back up to about 85%. It’s not wasting the ink, it’s just that a portion of it is in the tubes that connect to the print head. 

The 3830 has a flatbed scanner, but no document feeder. You have the option for duplex printing and this can carry over to duplex printing for documents that you copy. Perform a copy of one side of a page, the printer prints it, pulls the printed page back into the printer, then you flip the original copied page over, it scans it, then prints it out on the back of the printed page. I didn’t have any problems with this, but for those who need to copy many pages at a time, you may be better off with a different model from Epson. If you mostly copy a few pages, then you may be ok with this model. 

Duplex printing in a multi-function printer of this size is a great feature that others of similar form factor may not have. General printing of text is fast. The text on plain paper is very clear and the characters are well defined resulting in a clear printed page. It can also print edge to edge. I was able to print a photo on plain paper edge to edge. I won’t be using this printer for photos, but it’s nice to know I can add in photo paper and print a photo if I need to.

The printer setup took me about 10 minutes. That’s getting through network configuration, print head alignment, and updating the firmware. Epson has a mobile app that also works with the printer. I used the iOS version without issues to get the printer setup on my network. The color LCD screen on the printer isn’t a touch screen, but next to it Epson added a set of buttons that enable you to navigate the menu system. I didn’t have a problem using the buttons and they were responsive for me.

The box and packaging were more than sufficient to protect the printer. Within the box you’ll find the printer, power cable, full black/cyan/yellow/magenta ink bottles, a CD, and a quick start guide.

Overall, I’m impressed with the new design that does away with ink cartridges. I’ll be saving money in the long run with this new design. It has all the features I need such as duplex printing, scanning, copying, and wireless networking. I would like to see Epson add a touch screen in the future, but that is the only negative I can mention about the ET-3830. I would recommend this printer to anyone needing an all-in-one printer, but doesn’t need a document feeder.",2 months ago
435,436,6470012,Androidaholic,4,Good Little Printer!,The Epson - EcoTank ET-3830 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer is a well-designed printer with an easy-to-use color display and a well-executed set of functions that are easy to understand and figure out. Not only that I love the idea of a printer with tanks that you just fill up with ink bottles. What the heck took so long for printer manufacturers to come up with this idea? While I would much rather see printers have standard document feeders that can scan 15 pages at a time. Other than that I am very impressed with this Epson Eco=Tank printer. The small color on-screen settings functions were the easiest to navigate that I have seen and were simple to understand. I really appreciated the effort that was put in there. It did not take much time to get the printer up and running and the smartphone app and wireless capabilities are greatly appreciated. Another thing that I have never seen and really appreciate is a full slide-out paper tray for printed-out material. It is very well designed and thought out which seems to be an ongoing theme with this printer. This is my first Epson printer but I like what I am seeing. I would definitely recommend one to a friend or family member and has also caught my interest when looking for a new printer in the future!,2 months ago
436,437,6470012,dstracker,4,Great Printer for home or home office,"The Epson EcoTank ET3830 is perfect for home user or home office user. It prints clear and quickly. It’s packed extremely well. My box was a little dented on one corner, but the printer was unscathed. Included in the box – Quick setup guide, 5 bottles of ink (Black, yellow, cyan, magenta, and blue) and installation CD. The ink included should last up to 2 years according to the Epson EcoTank ET-3830 specifications. 

Setup was easy. The Epson EcoTank CD can be used for installation or you can download the installation file from the internet if you don’t have a CD/DVD reader. I downloaded the .exe file and installation instructions were easy to follow. During Setup you can decide whether you want to connect through WiFi or USB. I chose WiFi as my printer is in a different room from my laptop. Network wireless connection setup was quick and easy as the Epson EcoTank recognized my router’s IP address in less than a minute. Better and a lot quicker than my previous printers. 

The Epson EcoTank printer has a 2.4” LCD screen for all the various functions. Unfortunately, it’s not a touch screen so you have to use arrows to navigate through the different functions. The print is also very small and can sometimes be difficult to read. There is plenty of room on the front of the printer for a larger LCD screen.

Filling the printer with the included ink is even quicker than changing cartridges. The ink automatically stops when the respective color tank is full. Navigation through the display icons allows you to copy, print, scan, and perform any maintenance functions.

The Epson EcoTank ET-3830 does not have a fax. Its functions are only copy/print/scan which is perfect for most users. I don’t have a landline so it’s fine for me. 

The Epson EcoTank ET-3830 can also be operated through a cell phone app. The Epson Smart Panel app can be downloaded from Google Play or Apple App Store. With the Epson Smart Panel app, you can access all the functions of the printer from print to trouble shooting and everything in between. Printer settings are also available on the Smart Panel app. Connecting the app to the printer is as easy as search and connect. It took me less than a minute to connect the Smart Panel app to my Android Smartphone. The Epson Smart Panel app also allows guests to access the printer by simply scanning a bar code from your phone to the guest’s phone. No password is needed which makes the connection secure.

PROS summary – 
- Exclusive EcoFit ink bottles make filling tanks easy and without any mess
- Can print up to 7500 b/w and 6,000 color pages without refilling the tanks. This is approximately equal to 90 single ink cartridges.
- Ink can last up to 2 years before having to refill the tanks. 
- Save money from having to buy separate ink cartridges. 
- Paper tray can hold up to 250 sheets at one time.
- Printer can accept several different sizes, including photo paper and envelopes. 
- Epson Smart Panel app can access the printer in every way; print, copy, scan, maintenance, etc. 

CONS summary – 
- Epson Photo + - windows app can only accept up to 260 characters in the address bar for importing photos. This makes it impossible to import photos in subfolders that result in more than 260 characters. 
- Epson Photo + windows app also can only open a .etdx extension file, which is a template within the app. It does have several templates to arrange photos but is limited to the number of characters in the address bar. Hopefully Epson will change this in the future with an update to the Epson Photo + app.
- The LCD on the Epson EcoTank ET-3830 printer is very small, only 2.4”. There is enough space on the front panel that it could be made bigger for easier viewing.

The Epson EcoTank ET-3830 is a very good printer/copier/scanner for the home and/or home office for the fact that it uses ink tanks instead of ink cartridges. Thus, saving you a lot of money on separate cartridges. I do recommend this printer for the savings as well as the clarity of printed matter and photos. 

As for the Epson Photo + photo app, if you’re more than just a “take a picture and print” type of photographer, I suggest using a different photo app for importing and editing photos. The Epson Photo + app could be an excellent photo app, but Epson needs to allow the opening of ALL picture types (.jpg, .jpeg, etc.). Epson should also tweak the app to allow an unlimited amount of characters in the address bar instead of just 260 characters.",2 months ago
437,438,6470012,Ponskippa,5,Ink for months! Fast and Reliable Wireless Printer,"This Epson EcoTank 3830 was really quick and easy to set up. The printer comes with all the ink bottles you’ll need to fill the tanks. Epson claims you’ll get over 6,000 black/white and color pages out of these tanks. I can’t speak for those claims yet because I’ve only been using it for about a week but I believe it. My friend has a similar printer and hasn’t had to refill it yet and its been almost a year. You can download an app that will guide you through the set up, and you can also use the same app to print photos and documents as well as scan. It will also update the firmware for the printer for you. The printer prints really quick. It printed a full color page for me in less than 5 seconds. It honestly surprised me! The printer has a pull out tray that holds at least 100 pages. I was also able load 4x6 photo paper into that tray and print photos with it. The 4x6 photo print wasn’t the best quality, but it looks good to my eyes. I honestly think the app compresses the photo you are going to print when you transfer it wirelessly. Perhaps EPSON can update the app to allow higher quality photo prints on 4x6 paper. 
As far as filling the tanks with ink, It was very easy to do and did not cause any mess. I was worried I might spill some ink when filling it. The bottles have rubber stoppers that open and close when you put them on the printer refill slots. I’m very pleased with this printer and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast, high quality printer for their home or small business. It prints very fast, and I have not had any connection errors. The wireless printing has been very stable and reliable. Printing from your phone, tablet or computer is super easy with this printer. 

Pros: Fast, Reliable, Wireless capabilities, Long lasting affordable ink

Cons: No complaints from me",2 months ago
438,439,6470012,APFLORES413,3,"Clear printing, wastes paper and ink","So we were excited using this Epson ET-3830 as it comes with 1 year free ink. We soon realized that we would need a refill sooner than expected. 

Pros:
This printer is a little more compact than other printers we have had. It leaves a smaller area foot print and is lighter than others. The paper feed tray is directly underneath and you don’t need to feed it from a back tray, thus preventing jams. I like also that the feeder tray for a completed print is the size of a normal 8.5x11 paper and can be adjusted forward. 

Connecting it to my home wifi was such a breeze, probably the easiest of any printer as I can input my information via the app on my smart phone and not have to use the small display on the printer. The print quality is really clear and smooth, especially for a ink-jet printer. Setting it up and connecting it using the Epson app was an enjoyable experience because it sets up like a text message feed. 

And that’s where things got frustrating…

Cons:
Set up again was a breeze…but it took over 10 minutes because there was so many steps to do. This was the first time I’ve used an Epson printer that required me to fill the ink cartridges once I open it from the box. Each of the four color cartridges comes with a bottle of ink that you physically have to fill (which takes approx 75 seconds to fill). The ink fill was not the worst or it. 

Printing out the adjustment pages was what was very annoying. I printed up 5 pages of comparisons that you need to judge in order to adjust and calibrate, almost like going to the Optometrist (1 or 2, 3 or 4, etc). All of this calibration could’ve been concentrated on less pages. 

Another frustrating point, was I did not use that much ink on this calibration set up, and already the ink levels dropped 20%! I had left over ink in the bottles and ended up using all of them and it still did not fill the cartridges all the way! I’m afraid to see how much is used on a daily/weekly basis with printing. I see now that the 1-year free would come in handy.

Overall, I was very disappointed with this Epson ET-3830 for the reasons of wasting paper in initial set up and the ink usage for just a small amount of printing.",3 months ago
439,440,6470012,Epson,5,Epson Eco Tank,It is excellent that I bought this printer and also not having to buy ink every now and then. It prints well and clear.,2 weeks ago
440,441,6470012,RandallFlagg,5,"Great printer, wish the LCD was touch","Just opened the Epson ET-3830. The box contains the printer, a large bottle of black ink and 3 regular sized color inks, yellow, cyan and magenta, and a 110v power cord. I got the printer unboxed and out of the plastic, set it up on the desk and grabbed a handful of paper. Then I opened the setup guide because I always seem to struggle setting up printers. I see that there are two options, either by PC or with a smart phone. I chose to try my Android phone and scan the QR code in the quick set up guide. It takes me to Epson’s Smart Panel app in the play store and installs it. Does it work you ask? Yup, it sure does.

I start up the app and just follow the prompts. It is set up like a text message from a friend. You just go step by step and by the end the printer is ready to print and is connected to your Wi-Fi. Adding ink to the EcoTank is a breeze. The bottles have two tabs that fit into slots/ports on the printer so there isn’t any mess. They take a minute or so to fill up and auto stop when the tank is full regardless of whether the bottle still has ink in it. That leads to less waste since the bottles print so many more sheets than a print cartridge. There are 5 tests to make sure it is aligned. I did them all, but really didn’t need to. Every choice I was given stayed with the default, but YMMV. 

And that’s it. It just works. I can connect wirelessly to my other PC’s, my phone and tablets and my Mac Mini. There is also a USB and Ethernet port in the back should you want to connect it that way. It has auto 2-sided printing and enough ink to print 7500 black ink pages and 6000 color pages. It may seem trivial but having front loading paper is important especially once you’ve used a printer that loads in the top or back. It holds half a ream (250 sheets) allowing for less loading and more productivity. My only disappointment is that the LCD is still not touchscreen. With the icon’s lit up, I forget and try pressing them all the time. Most if not all my other printers have touchscreen controls and I love them. Here, it’s another step or two depending on if I try and press the LCD screen first. If it were the only printer I used, I’m sure it wouldn’t be and issue. Muscle memory would take over after a few uses, but with multiple printers, I never seem comfortable with the directional and ‘ok’ buttons. That said, it’s a tiny inconvenience on an otherwise great printer.

Some details off the box: Scan resolution is 1200x2400 dpi/ppp and print resolution is up to 4800x1200 dpi/ppp. ISO print speed is 15/8.0 ISOppm and two-sided ISO print speed is 6.5/4.5 ISOppm. I haven’t tested it, but the box states it works with Apple AirPrint.",2 months ago
441,442,6470012,Justjohnne,4,"Great Printer, qaulity, cost and function","Not normally an Epson guy but after setting up and using this for a couple of weeks I'm sold. Set up is accomplished via the app, which is super simple. The app walks you through step by step, almost too helpful.. 

Once set up print a test page, make a few adjustments if needed, it walks you through that too, and viola. One thing I will caution you on, when filling the ink, don't be in a hurry and don't assume it won't drip. They have designed a great product but you will get a small drip after removing the ink bottler from the printer, just be aware. 

Printing quality is great for an inkjet type printer. I haven't had time to calculate the cost but the convenience of refilling the unit instead of buying print cartridges certainly appeals to me. I have gone through quite a bit of ink, which included the initial calibration pages. 

The scanner and soft wear works flawlessly. I would like the option for a feeder but there is only a flatbed scanner. 

Overall, I like the printer, features but am cautiously optimistic about operational costs.

Overall I would recommend this printer, I would upgrade to the model with a feeder if you are planning on scanning many documents.",2 months ago
442,443,6470012,PhillipB,5,Epson has always been great.,"EcoTank ET-3830 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer is a great all around printer scanner.

Physical set up took about 15 mins with ink and alignment and charging the ink into the printer
Setup via Android app was pretty easy and quick.
WiFi setup was fast
Setup for cloud scanning requires registration of the printer and going through their portal initially. After you do it once you are all set.
USB setup after you get the right drivers was about 10 mins of time with windows 10

Printing was pretty fast.
Color pictures was really good. My kid had a project the other day and it spit out the photos he needed pretty fast and clear.
After initially charging the ink and my kids heavy color print job (about 10 pages of full 8x10s) it brought the ink down 1 tick mark. Looks like normal printing won't cause for ink to be bought for a while.... Awesome.

Printer buttons and interface was easy to use. Wished this came with touch screen. But even without touch screen the menus were easy to follow.

Physical Color of white is nice. It tends to hide dust better than black. Size is good does not take too big of a foot print.

444,445,6470012,davenesf,4,What a big bang for the buck,"As everyone knows, traditional inkjet cartridges are ridiculously expensive and never last as long as you think they should. Although I have only used this printer for a week and cannot tell you how long the bottles of ink will last, doing the math on the cost of ink versus yield of pages show this is a much bigger bang for the buck.
 
First, the plusses. It was exceptionally easy to set up and connect to my network - the simplest printer to set up EVER. Downloaded and installed the drivers and software from their website versus digging out my old DVD drive to connect to my computer and use the included CD. I was very surprised to see they actually included a CD with the software and drivers. You get the latest versions when you download from their website anyway. The software walks you through each step and could not be easier. VERY painless and easy experience! The ink bottles filled the tanks completely, but there was a little left in each bottle once the tanks were full. When first set up, it goes through a priming and calibration process that uses some ink. When it was done, I was able to put the remainder of the ink in the tanks so there was none left in the bottle that I would need to store. They also key each color bottle so it is impossible to put it in the wrong tank. Engineers thought this one through!

Now, the limitations. I will start with screen size - a little small and not a touchscreen display, but it is functional. I would have preferred a larger one. Second, I do not leave my printer turned on when not using it and it is a two-step process to shut down. First, you press the power key and then you must move the right arrow on the display to confirm you wish to turn it off. I thought this was an unnecessary step. Next, it does not have fax capability which is nearly standard on multifunction printers nowadays. I knew it did not have automatic document feed or two-side printing, but the more expensive models do. Print speed is about average for printers in this price range.

The footprint of the unit is good and the paper tray holds an acceptable number of sheets. The quality of prints is as excellent as any other printer from Epson who is known for high-quality prints. 

For a home-use printer that is economical to buy and operate, you will look long and hard to find anything better. Other than the nitpicks mentioned, I recommend this printer.",2 months ago

We use this for home use of printing, scanning & copying. The set up was ax but challenging with locating Xfinity but eventually got it accomplished. The display on the front is small and nt extremely intuitive but if you have used an Elsinore before you eventually figure out how to get what you need. If you change a setting on the front panel it remains at that setting so you need to remember to change it back once you have completed that task… you get what you pay for I guess. Prints fast but is way noisier than my 13 year old Epson.  We have had it for about a month and so far it’s a keeper.",3 days ago
446,447,6470012,Dan292,5,"easy setup, good print quailty, ink lasts forever","The Epson ET-3830 is a fine printer. I’ve setup and used Epson Ecotank printers like this one before, and this one is no different except that there is now an app you can download to your phone to guide you through the setup process. Previously one had to actually read a piece of paper as a guide to the setup process, but now everything has to have a smartphone app. 

In any event, I encountered no issues in the setup process, and I have to say that I really appreciate the permanent ink tank system the Epson printers use. Instead of constantly purchasing, using, and then throwing away ink cartridges where you’re always concerned that you’ve thrown away good ink, with these refillable tanks, you never waste ink. You just refill the tanks as needed, and you can see for yourself that the ink is fully used. Inkjet printer manufacturers should have come up with a system like this long ago, and, in my opinion, everything else being equal, I would choose an Epson Ecotank printer over another brand just because of the refillable-tank feature.

Like most printers nowadays, this one can be used wirelessly, and I had no trouble connecting it to my home network. But be aware that it doesn’t see 5 GHz networks, only the older 2.4 GHz networks. That was no problem except that, during the setup process, the app tries to connect the printer to the same network your phone is connected to. If your phone is connected to a 5 GHz network (my home wireless system has both 2.4 and 5 GHz networks), the attempt will fail, and then the app takes you through the process of connecting a 2.4 GHz network. 

This printer is an all-in-one, so you can copy, print, and scan, but it does not have a document feeder, so if you have multiple pages to scan or copy, you’ll have to load them one at a time. But if you’re regularly scanning multi-page documents, you want a dedicated document scanner, anyway. Scanning is simple with the included ScanSmart software, and I have to point out that the scanner is the quietest I’ve ever experienced. The scan head moves across the platen completely silently. I actually had to look to make sure that the unit was actually scanning.

Print quality is excellent with both documents and photos. I routinely print 4 x 6 photos for my wife to send to relatives, and this Epson printer is perfect for this. It also does well with large, 8.5 x 11 photo paper.

The printer’s front-panel control is a small screen where you use the adjacent keyboard to select options. It is not a touch-screen, but you quickly get used to how the menus operate and how to move among them. 

As far as how long full ink tanks last, let me say that, with my previous Epson printer, I never ran out of ink before this printer came along, and I started using it in place of the older one. I would say it was a good nine-months to a year of daily use of my previous printer without running out of ink. I like ink tanks that last.

If you would like to be rid of the need to continually purchase ink cartridges, and you want a good printer/scanner to boot, you won’t go wrong with Epson ET-380.",3 months ago
447,448,6470012,OwnFault,5,Excellent printer - But read why you need this one,"After more than 25 years of using printer ink cartridges, only to discard them when they dry up or become empty, the Epson eco-tank became more attractive. 

Three different inkjet printers failed me at about the same time. Each of them were inexpensive to buy, but ink cartridges were expensive. Realizing that purchasing another set of ink cartridges to try and fix one of the printers would cost over $100, I elected to try this printer.

Caution: the two lower models of this printer, do not have paper trays. They only have rear loading paper. For that reason I opted for this model.

It was exceedingly simple to set up, and after filling it with ink and running test images, the residual ink in the bottles was easily added. No waiting for a cartridge to empty before inserting another.",1 week ago
448,449,6470012,JBCTECH,5,Solid Product for this Category,"The Epson - EcoTank ET-3830 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer is a solid product for it's category. 

Wireless set-up was very smooth using the Epson app. There's also an option for setting it up via a direct cable, though there are no USB cables included. Filling the ink tanks is simple and secure and it was ready for use immediately (though I chose to upgrade the firmware first). 

Print quality is solid and pictures look great on photo paper, which is a consistent strength of Epson printers. I like having a large-capacity paper tray, an adjustable control panel and easy-to-use copy/scanner area. I'm also a big fan of the ink-tank solution as opposed to cartridges.

Less than $50 for an all-in-one inkjet printer could still be a lot of money for some more than others. That being said, this small footprint AIO does it all. And pretty well, too. Speed is average for the unit to queue and start printing, and the noise level is noticeable but for the most part not enough to be annoying. Perhaps if you were printing a 30 page job and the printer was beside you.... but how many times does that happen?
Print results are good, both colour and greyscale. Clean crisp output even in normal 300dpi. Keep in mind that this is a light duty printer for general home/home office type use. It won't disappoint used in this manner. 
Setup was a breeze. I went WiFi from the get-go and the setup utility had no issues finding the device on the network and finishing the task. No need for alignment. It was excellent out of the box.
Scan works well, quick and quiet. Same for the copy feature. And it looks good on the desktop or wherever you decide to place it. A ton of other software comes with the install CD. But I only wanted a printer so opted not to install any of it except for the manual, which helped out later on.
The 3620 has an wake-up setting that allows it to sleep until a print request is received. I used this setting for a few weeks after install and it worked fine. One day all computers in the house couldn't see the printer. Tried several fixes, rebooted, reset the router, powered off and on several times. Nothing worked. Last gasp, check the manual. Sure enough, it had step by step troubleshooting that resolved the issue first try. Moral - install the manual during setup.

Since getting it two months ago,  I’ve scanned several items, and printed maybe 2 dozen pages.   As such a low volume user, this Canon replaced a functional HP all-in-one inkjet that was wasting (expensive) ink cartridges because they kept drying out.

PROs:  
- Print quality
- higher scan resolution than many in its class
-  easy printing from an ipad. My wife can send a recipe from her ipad and will print double-sided if requested.

CONs:
- Weak WIFI setup documentation. I found other owners complaints about the setup instructions to be valid.  The doc is poorly organized, vague in places, incomplete in others.  Fortunately, a web search will find reviews and other articles with tips.
- You have to leave the paper door open to print. Nowhere in ANY of the reviews I read (nor in the documentation) was this ever mentioned.  Every home printer I’ve owned over the last 30 years has had the usual paper tray that you pull open, load, and close- but not this one.

533,534,6348957,YourMainDude,1,Big Disappointment...,"Having a vast amount of experience with HP printing devices over the years, I can confidently state that potential purchasers should try to avoid this product for a while. HP is known for clunky software/firmware implementation and there are vast resources available which can be read online & support this historical context.

Immediately upon setting up my printer, I went through the steps of installing the various software packages available on their support website. There's what is called a ""Full"" package, there are ""Universal"" and ""Basic"" driver packages as well. HP installation routines will commonly crash or become stuck with no apparent reason. To compound the issues further - that I faced - the internal printing mechanism produced some horrendous sounds when it went through it's initial 'power-up' sequences for the very first time. I heard what sounded like some extreme mechanical collisions or slamming.

Once I ran through several install/uninstall attempts I was finally able to get the printer to work properly utilizing the ""Universal"" driver package. Printing, scanning, copying and communication to the MFP's internal configuration all appeared somewhat normal. I did perform a firmware update along the way but this new firmware didn't fix any of the error codes I experienced.

When I queried the ""event log"" of the printer (through an Ethernet connection), I discovered critical failure notifications. I've attached the screen shot of what I first observed. I also receive consistent error messages that the printer is out-of-paper at the end of print jobs. Something is terribly amiss here. I've attached a screen capture of that as well.

HP Smart is an application that will automatically install in the background of a Windows 10 machine, and this software will not only provide error messages and configuration settings - but it also links into something called the HP print & scan doctor. Essentially a self help diagnostic app. The HP Smart app is a prime mover in the popping up 'out-of-paper' notifications in the Win 10 notification tray.

I do have some good things to say about this printer.
It's faster than the M426 generation and looks to employ more power saving and toner saving feature controls than it's predecessors. Perceived sound can be highly subjective but my particular unit seems much louder than older HP MFP's I've used. Perhaps this is related to some internal, mechanical issues.

The Good:
Faster and noticeably more precise toner application - translated - clearer printing.
Compact in overall size & work space footprint.

The Bad:
Poor software implementation and a tedious installation experience.
Louder in operation.
False positives with the consistent, out of paper error messages.
Prone to ""Fuser Drive (internal hardware) 50.04.00 Errors"".

I can not recommend the HP - LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdw printer at the present time.",2 years ago

537,538,6348957,Derek,5,"Great, great, office printer","The LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdw is surprisingly compact for being capable of so much. I was expecting a huge box, but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the small footprint. Setup was easy. I used the printer's touchscreen to set up a wifi connection (a USB connection could also be used). It connected easily to my internet, and my mobile devices saw it immediately as a printer on the network. I printed documents from an iPad and an Android phone, and that was before I did the PC setup! Loved the connectivity. There is an option if you are an IT person and want to set the printer up for an office environment to do so. Since I am using this in my personal office, I did not try setting up the office environment option.

I went to HP's site and downloaded the PC software, including the scanning tool. What's great about this, the printer can scan two-sided documents via the auto-feeder and send them to any computer that you have the scanning software installed on, as well as handheld devices. I tried this with several documents, and only had one glitch where I had to power the printer off and then back on because the scanner locked up. The restart corrected the issue, and I haven't had one since.

I love the fact that this unit can print two-sided copies as fast as other units I have had that only print one side. I printed a 17-page peer-review on leadership studies in less than 7 seconds (double-sided). Simply impressive! Print quality was outstanding. I had several other folks send docs to be printed. Both the Macs and the Windows PC's we tested found the printer on my network immediately and printed to it without having to do anything special.

I tested the fax component of the machine (yes, people do still actually use those...) by faxing a 6-page document to my workplace fax machine and then back. No issues getting dial-tone, no issues sending the fax, and I set it up to print me a success page after it was sent. 

In an office environment, or even if you need a high-speed, quality printer at home to scan, fax and print double-sided black and white copies, you can't do much better than this HP. I can't think of an all-in-one printer that I have liked as much as this one, thus the 5-star review. Highly recommended!",10 months ago

541,542,6348957,Dan292,4,"Excellent printer, non-trivial setup","There are two aspects to a review of this printer—of the printer/scanner/copier/fax machine itself and of the setup process, the latter of which was anything but trivial, at least for me.

First, as a printer, this is an HP Laserjet. That’s all I should really have to say. The print quality is going to be wonderful because HP is the gold standard of laser printers, having practically invented them and having been in the business of making them for more than three decades. This printer is no different. I’ve owned or used many HP Laserjets starting in the late 1980s. The build quality, smoothness of operation, and print quality of this printer are all excellent.

There are three printer trays, so you can add rarely-used types of paper (colored paper or envelopes, for instance) in one tray without disturbing the store of normal paper in another tray. The scanner function works fine and is easily controlled with the Windows SCAN program. Scanning right at the printer works well, too, as does copying as well as does printing directly from a flash drive connected to one of the printer’s USB ports, so long as what you want to print is a pdf file. 

The printer comes out of the box with a toner cartridge installed, so getting it up and printing is no more complicated than removing shipping tape here and there and plugging it in. Connection to a computer (let’s call it the host computer) via USB cable is a simple matter as well, and the setup process has you visiting the HP website to download and install the drivers as well as install what’s called the HP “Smart App” to also control the printer.

Where I ran into some problems in setup was in getting the printer to connect to a remote computer (one not connected to the printer by a USB cable) wirelessly. Connecting the printer to your wireless network is simple and is done via a wizard accessible through the printer’s touchscreen. Just select your network, input the password, and you’re done. Then you go to the remote computer and add the printer as you would add any printer. But you’re presented with a couple of options here. If you have set the printer up on the host computer to be a “shared” printer, you’ll find it on the list of available printers when you go to add the printer to the remote computer. The process is straightforward and involves installing the same HP Smart App that was installed on the host computer.

But you are also presented with a second option in installing the printer on the remote computer, and this is supposed to be one of the great features of this printer. By having it connected directly to your wireless network, you can also, in the Add Printer section of Windows, add it as a “Direct Wireless” printer. Connection in this manner allows printing to the printer without the host computer even being turned on, which is always a necessity when printing to a network printer that is hard-wired to a host computer. And this is where I ran into problems. No matter what I did, I could not get the remote computer to print to the printer. If I uninstalled the Direct Wireless printer and installed it as a network printer shared by the host computer, I had no problems. But I could not install it the Direct Wireless way, which was disappointing as this is supposed to be, as I noted above, one the printer’s significant advantages and one I was hoping to use.

So it was off to chat with HP on their support site, and after about 45 minutes of interaction with the tech (who was quite patient with me and quite helpful), which included several minutes of his assuming control of my computer via a remote-desktop hookup, he solved the problem by creating a new, separate TCP/IP port for this printer. Once that was done, everything worked fine. It’s just unfortunate to have to go through this process at all. I have been buying and setting up printers since the 1980s, and I’ve rarely encountered a situation where I wanted to set the printer up as a network printer and I did not have one kind of problem or another. It’s usually a “printer offline” problem, but this time it was something new and something different.

So I give the printer four stars. As I noted at the top, as a printer/scanner/fax/copier, it works great, and I would have expected nothing less. But setup, at least for me, took half a day to accomplish because I tried several other approaches first (including the time-honored “uninstall/reinstall”) before resorting to an online chat. I can’t say that another person will experience the same problems I did or, conversely, will have the installation process go smoothly. My experience might be an outlier. But I can only speak from my experience, and I consider myself a pretty computer-sophisticated person who has built several computers on his own as well as having, as noted above, installed many printers of all types over the years.",2 years ago
542,543,6348957,Waggly,3,Decent B&W MFP for home or small business,"HP Laser Jet Pro MFP M428fdw 

I find this to be a decent B&W laser printer that seems to largely perform as advertised. Packaging was easy to handle and instructions were easy to follow. I set this up in a home environment using a Windows 10 laptop connected to the internet via wifi. I am running a higher end AC wifi router. 

Duplex printing and scanning worked as expected. I found the print speed to be as advertised at about 40ppm. Print quality was also good and consistent from page to page. I was not overly impressed with the scanning quality. The document feeder had a tendency to pull pages in slightly crocked and the resolution of the scans was too low in my opinion. I calculated that the cost of running this unit is about 3.5 cents/page + paper cost based on a standard HP 58A cartridge with a 3k page life at about $105 through the HP Shopping app that loads automatically. 

I was not able to get scan to email from the app on my laptop to work. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m sure I could look it up online and get it to work, but I got frustrated and gave up on that part. I was able to scan to email directly from the printer without any issues. The unit also copies easily. The touch screen is easy to navigate and fairly intuitive if you have spent any time around HP printers. 

I was able to print directly from my android cell phone without having to install any additional apps. The printer showed up on my phone automatically because my phone was on the same wifi network. It supports a wide array of mobile printing platforms from Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc. 

I also turned off wifi and plugged directly in via usb. Everything worked perfectly. The installation I will describe in a minute set up all forms of connectivity at once. 

All in all, I like this unit and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick B&W Laser Printer that is easy to set up and use (except for the scan to email from a computer). 

Now I will walk you through my setup experience. I did not set up the hard-line network connection or the fax functionality as my home network is not conducive to those features. 

Upon opening the box, I saw right away that they had a diagram explaining the best way to remove the unit from the box. This is helpful as the unit is a bit bulky and heavy, weighing in at about 29lbs. Following these simple instructions made it easy to remove. Included in the box was the printer, HP toner (preinstalled), a power cord, a USB printer cable and a phone cable for the fax functionality. 

The first thing the instruction book has you do is set up the paper tray. It is fairly simply. Just pull it out of the unit and adjust sliding guide rails to match your paper size. I set up for standard 8.5x11 paper. I did realize the hard way that the unit needs to be on a hard, flat surface in order for the paper tray to slide easily. I initially had it sitting on a folding chair with a padded seat. It would not slide back in until I put it on a hard, flat surface. I should have known better, but here is a chance for you to make fun of me and learn from my mistakes. 

After setting up the paper tray, I removed all of the tape holding the doors and units together, and plugged in the power cords as instructed. I did NOT plug in the USB cable as the instructions did not tell me to do so. I then went to the web site as instructed and chose to use the Easy Start wizard to set up the printer. 

After my laptop downloaded the installer application, I tried to launch it only to find that Windows threw a warning because it is not a Microsoft verified app. I simply told my laptop to “Install Anyway” and had no issues. The app automatically detected the printer in my house even though I was not physically connected to it. I’m not sure if it used Bluetooth or Direct Connect functionality to accomplish this, but it worked very well. I then chose the Auto Wireless Setup option. 

The software then automatically joined the printer to my home network so that I could print over wifi. It also set up wifi direct and prompted me to turn on device sharing on my laptop to make everything work. You don’t need to know what all that means. The point is, it works if you click your way through the setup application. 

It then downloaded the full featured driver and software set for the printer. The current software package is 277mb. The HP website was quite slow. Even on my high-speed internet connection, it took almost 20 minutes to download the software. That was probably a fluke as HP isn’t normally a slow website for me. Once installation started, it pretty much took care of itself. It automatically loaded 10 apps over the course of about 5-7 minutes. The installation window disappears and reappears several times during this process. Just be patient. It works. It will tell you when it is complete. 

After installation said it was complete, the fax setup wizard popped up. There is a skip button that I clicked since I don’t have a fax line here at home. It then had me register the device. I did note that the HP website I used to start this whole process never closes on its own. Once you get to this stage you can simply close your web browser. I also noted that the printer rebooted automatically after I finished the software installation. I’m not sure what it was doing, but I could not print to it until after that reboot. If it doesn’t automatically reboot and you can’t print to it, you might need to power cycle it once to get it going. 

There was a 2nd instruction sheet in the box that tells you how to update the firmware. It is simple to follow. You just go to the HP support website and download the firmware updater. I followed the instructions, but when I got to the actual update process, it told me that I already had the latest firmware. I would recommend checking for firmware updates when you set up the machine just in case they have released something new since this review. 

The installation put 4 icons on my desktop. The scanning app, printer assistant, shopping, and a setup icon for the printer and scanner doctor app. The Printer Assistant is really all you need to keep handy. It has shortcuts to everything else built into the interface. The scanning app make it easy to scan to your computer in either jpg or pdf. As I said earlier, I couldn’t get scan to email working and gave up since it wasn’t important to me. I found the assistant app easy to navigate and pretty intuitive. There are more advanced setting available for custom network configurations and such, but I did not need to use those options in my simple home network. I am an experience IT professional, however, so I looked through the more advanced settings and surmised that it should be relatively easy for an IT technician to set this up in a standard domain environment. 

That’s about it. I hope you have found this review helpful.",2 years ago

545,546,6348957,zboot,4,"Good Pro laser jet printer, Minor Scan Issue","The HP LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdw is a mouthful and a laserjet black and white printer. So, off the bat, we should expect this should have above average black and white print quality and great printing speed. In addition to being a wireless printer, this can also scan, copy, and fax documents.

In the box is the printer itself, power cable, USB and phone cable, plus guides. The cables are a nice plus. Typically, wireless printers don't include a USB cable and it's been years since I've seen a new fax capable printer actually ship with the requisite phone cable. Setup is pretty straightforward from the touchscreen. It's similar (if not identical) to HP's other touchscreen home facing enabled inkjet printers. Even though you may not use it, you will need to go through the fax setup as well. One difference from some other printers is that the touchscreen is on a pivot. You can move it around - either to better match the location in which the printer will be installed or avoid glare from lighting. In my home office, I didn't need that per se, but it's a nice touch. Also, the toner cartridge is preloaded so no need to fumble around doing that. You'll learn how to install it when the ink runs out.

Print quality and speed were good. As usual, my setup is for wireless printing and scanning. Setting up a scan to a network folder was pretty easy and in the process of doing so, I discovered that one can also configure the printer to scan to Sharepoint! That said, the workflow I continue to use is scanning to a network drive, then copying to Sharepoint as needed. It does scan in color, so no worries though obviously the copy function results in a black and white print. One thing that's interesting is the scan quality is different via the automatic feeder versus scan panel. That is quite annoying due to the fact that most of the time, you're scanning a series of documents.

I noticed the box hypes up the printer's security. I'm not sure I buy all the network protection features it has and it does make me worried about using cheaper print cartridges upon replacement. In all, it does it's job well aside from the different scan quality issue.",8 months ago

553,554,6470011,YourMainDude,4,Epson Quality & Value,"The Epson - EcoTank ET-4850 is a solid AIO ink-jet printer. I so wanted to give this product a resounding 5 Stars but considering the overall design and the obvious physical layout - I truly believe that at this price-point, Epson could have easily included a bigger LCD-touch screen. For average sized hands (fingers), the provided touch panel is usable but would be much more user friendly with at least another inch of diagonal size - much less a mere half inch more.
At 2.4 inches, this touch interface comes off a bit cramped during the entire setup process and during daily use. Looking across the entire line of affordable Epson inkjet printers, this is the only model with the touch screen. IMHO Epson should have upped the touch screen size and included one on the lower model without the document feeder.

With that out of the way, there really isn't much else to complain about on the EcoTank ET-4850. I'm a huge fan of refillable tank printers. It's the future!

This AIO includes full-on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB and RJ11 (phone/fax) connectivity. The unit is well built and easy to set up. It took me all of about 20 minutes to print my 1st test page. It was nice to see Epson include an installation CD with all the needed software. You get all the customary drivers & utilities along with an easy to run Software Update program. The process was smooth & painless and I was even notified that there was an available Firmware update during the set up. I own other Epson products and I have to say that they've put a great deal of effort into making their setup & software installation routines intuitive & enjoyable. Other printer manufacturers can learn from this.

The EcoTank ET-4850 handles a wide variety of paper types and in its most basic mode, holds 250 sheets of standard paper. While printing a variety of documents & pictures, I didn't experience a single miss-feed or paper jam. Photos come out with brilliant clarity and amazing color depth. Regular color documents are produced with crisp text and reliably consistence ink dispersion across the entire sheet and across multiple pages.

The printer is about average in terms of noise output during operation but it is very quick. The auto document feeder is also solid in operation and a nice feature to have if you do a lot of copying or scanning of multi-page documents.

This is my second EcoTank model and I can personally vouch for the big cost advantages of the refillable tank ecosystem. Once you've owned & used this type of printer, you'll never go back to using wasteful sealed cartridges ever again.

Pros:
Solid construction
Smooth guided setup with the provided CD disk
2-sided printing
Scan to Computer from the printer control panel is brilliant & useful
Excellent color rendition across documents & photos
The complete in-home office tool for those that also require a fax machine
High-capacity paper tray
Super economical ink system

Cons:
Touch screen is simply too small @ this price point and hinders ease-of-use",2 months ago

**WHAT’S IN THE BOX**

• Epson ET-4850
• Four bottles of Epson ink, with enough ink in the box for up to two years of printing
• Power cord
• Documentation, including Software CD for Windows, warranty, quick start guide

**THE SETUP**

There are two ways to set up the printer. For users who already are part of the Epson universe with the Epson SmartPanel app on their phone OR getting the product ready to use, setting up Wi-Fi through the printer’s display without first having the app. Both methods ask the user to follow the prompts either on mobile phone’s screen or on the printer’s 2.4” color touchscreen display.

Users are asked at a strategic point to install the ink from the supplied ink bottles, the printer responds to the ink being loaded, and then we are asked to confirm that ink is installed. The printer finishes priming the print mechanism for printing.

Load some paper and set the paper size guides in the generous, 250-sheet paper tray.

When these basic settings are completed, the Epson can print a test page to confirm its print alignment settings are good and that’s it, ready to go, except for any needed firmware updates.

Loading about 100 sheets of plain paper in the tray.

I chose to set up the printer for wireless only, though it has an Ethernet port for those who want a hard-wired connection to the network. There is also a standard USB Printer connection for those who want hard-wired connection to a computer. Finally, there is a standard RJ11 phone port with another port, a pass-through for a phone line connection necessary for fax use. The other jack can accommodate a hard wired telephone. None of the requisite cabling is included.

Finally, with the printer on Wi-Fi, computers need the software to access the ET-4850 and print, copy, scan and fax. As with virtually all new printers or all-in-one devices like this one, Windows and Mac computers will automatically download the software on the computer recognizes the connected printer. All our Macs and all our Windows computers were easily set up for printing and scanning, with one Windows PC set up for faxing.
Epson Remote Print was set up according to direction enabling the ability to print from a laptop or desktop computer to an Epson Email-enabled product anywhere in the world. 
Printing from mobile devices, from computers and as directed on the touch screen are all possible.

Scanning to a mobile device, computer and cloud is available. 

Tipping out the bottom of the display for best viewing angle, it is time to . . . 


**PUT IT TO THE TEST**

From a Mac, I sent a Web page to print, then a 3x5 photo in digital form. The photo lacked the snap I was hoping for, so I loaded a sheet of Epson photo paper. Much better!

Copying (up to 100 copies) is easy both from the ADF or on the platen. Scanning, too, looked nearly perfect at all quality settings. Of course, higher resolution scans, as with prints and copies, take longer than at lower quality settings.

Printing envelopes loaded in the paper tray worked well as expected. 

Scanning test – passed with flying colors.

**WHAT’S MISSING?**

There is no bypass slot for straight-through printing of iron-on patches or on any media that ought not to be bent and rolled through the normal paper path. All media must be picked up from the paper tray.

**CONCLUSION**

Except for a non-existent single-sheet bypass pick-up slot, this is a well-executed all-in-one printer. There is added value by virtue of inexpensive replacement ink bottles and the initial generous supply of ink included in the box. It’s a good deal all around.

**WARRANTY**

One year manufacturer’s warranty increases to two years with registration, including full unit replacement.",3 months ago
555,556,6470011,SirGalahad,5,The Best Printer I've Owned,"The main reason to buy this printer is the EcoTank. As that is where the money saving is. They report this printer should net you about 6,000 color pages or 7,500 black/white pages before needing to buy a new ink BOTTLE (approximate numbers which may vary). Those bottles bought individually are $20 for black, or $13 a piece for color. Or if bought as a bundle $39. Compare that to the traditional ink cartridge which prints about 220 – 350 pages per cartridge for about $17 (for black) or $39 (color) per refill (again approximately). Additionally, there is less waste with bottles as they can be reused and there are less of them due to lasting longer. Which is a win all around. These EcoFit Bottles also lock into place before they transfer the ink into the printer, so you aren’t going to be dealing with a mess and makes the whole process very easy even for novices such as myself. This is the whole reason I bought this printer. 

But you may be wondering why this printer costs more upfront compared to other ink cartridge printers. The reason is because their business model is to make money off their printers over their ink where it is opposite with others. In the end this actually saves you money in the long run, but you are paying upfront which some people don’t like.

Thankfully, you still get a modern All-In-One Printer which supports printing, coping, and scanning. You navigate between all the options via a very small 2.4” touch screen which is very responsive but doesn’t have a glass covering which makes it feel a bit less premium. It can Fax 100 pages at a time. The scan resolution is 1200x2400 DPI which is good. I didn’t fax anything so didn’t test that. But did find that the scan resolution was good and didn’t have any issues with it. The biggest negative is the print speed. Which is 15.5 pages per minute for black/white pages or 8.5 pages per minute for color which is bit slow and not recommended for those who value speed and print a lot. Compared to about 20 pages per minute for black/color from your typical ink cartridge printer. Thankfully with a resolution of 4800x1200 DPI pages come out looking clear with easily readable print. Especially, if you calibrate the printer which takes some time but is totally worth it. I found it to be better than my other ink cartridge printers that cost about $100 – $200 which I would expect at a higher price point. For those who care it supports plain paper, photo paper (but isn’t a photo printer), glossy paper, and matte paper up to 8.5”x14” legal (normal printer paper is 8.5”x11”). The tray itself holds 250 pages (which is about half a paper ream) and it has an auto document feeder and supports automatic two-sided printing (which I really like as I hate doing it manually) which works well. Printer noise is minimal, the specs report 52 dBA, which to my ears is about right. Normal human conversation is about 60 – 70 dBA for comparison. They say the monthly duty cycle (how many pages it can print per month) is 5,000. Obviously, I didn’t test that because I’m not someone who prints a lot.

Moving onto the smart features this printer supports either wired (ethernet) or wireless. Initial setup is easy. It will have you download the Epson Smart Panel app, which then literally walks you through the process of setting everything up via instant message which I thought was pretty neat. Through this it shows you how to install the ink, connects it to a Wi-Fi network (appears to only work on 2.4 GHz bands), goes through a 10 minute ink initialization (which can damage the printer if there isn’t any ink in it), went through a firmware update, alighted the printer for the best printer quality, Epson Connect (cloud printing aka smartphone printing), setup via wireless on a PC (usual way), and last you can setup fax features but need a phone cable to allow that which I didn’t do. Overall, the process was seamless and easy as it gave instructions the entire way with links when required. But was a lot longer compared to other ink cartridge printers (mostly due to that 10 minute ink initialization and alignment settings). You can connect directly to the printer via USB 2.0 (instead of the old school printer type cable). The same Epson Smart Panel App allows your smart device to print. You can also set it up to be voice activated. So, it checks all the boxes for a modern age printer.

Overall footprint of the device is very small, especially for how much it can do. Which I like A LOT. The build quality is great and a lot better than your typical printer. I found it to be the best “home” printer that I’ve ever felt regarding build quality. With the only loose tray being the one for the paper. I like that you can see how much ink you have left by peering at the front bottom right which isn’t digital but a window. Which I prefer over a digital reading and keeps me up to date on my ink usage better since it’s kind of right there. Touch screen doesn’t have a glass front (which makes it feel not as premium) but touches are very responsive and accurate. When I was scrolling or going from menu to menu I didn’t notice any lag. There are also a lot of customizability settings such as quiet mode. It also shows how strong of a connect to the Wi-Fi you have along with the Bluetooth connection to your phone. Epson App is also easy to navigate and user friendly. 

CONCLUSION: 

This is an excellent printer that you pay upfront for with savings later due to the ink savings. Print speed is a bit slow and initial cost is high. Touch screen could be bigger but is very responsive without lag. Epson Smart Panel App is useful for those who only own smart devices (phones/tablets). Overall, I have very little cons with a lot of pros. I find it to be a worthy investment if you aren’t printing a crazy amount of pages monthly and don’t mind slower print speeds. It’s easily the best printer I’ve ever owned. But also costs about 2x as much.",2 months ago
556,557,6470011,SimpleLiving,5,Excellent and Innovative printer,"This Epson EcoTank printer is excellent, and it is a must-have consumer office machine. Gone are the old spontaneous frequent replacement cartridge. Now anyone can make an economical print in color and high volume. I am an accountant, and I got this printer exclusively for my home office. Printing cost is reasonable that now my wife and two kids use a lot for their virtual school. It is getting plenty of use. Setup and connection take about 20-25 minutes to complete and require careful step-by-step instructions to fill the tanks with ink. I downloaded and used the Epson Smart Panel app for the entire setup (this is optional). Each color bottle is uniquely keyed, which makes it easy and error-free to fill each color tank. The uniquely keyed bottles are an excellent idea to prevent filling a color tank with a wrong color. Filling the tank, one must be careful not to squeeze the refill bottles. After the tanks were all filled, I followed a few more steps and connected the printer to the Wi-Fi. The touch screen responds very well, but the size could be a bit larger for bigger fingers.
I like the convenience that I can print and scan from a mobile device. The Epson Smart Panel app has a tone of features on how to print or scan. A unique printing is ID cards; I can print both sides of any ID using the app in two steps. Scanning is fast with either the glass flatbed or the automatic document feeder. So far, I haven’t had any issue with the automatic document feeder. Once you get used to the machine, you will be scanning and printing stacks of documents. The prints come out with vibrant colors, and the blacks are dark enough. This Epson EcoTank printer does its primary purpose very well: to print fast and economically without compromising quality.",2 months ago
557,558,6470011,HBCUgrad13,4,A Super Printer,"The Epson EcoTank ET-4850 is a great home office printer. Setup was quick, and instructions were easy to understand. The size of the device was my initial concern. Fortunately, it sits comfortably on my desk by just being taller and having more depth than the average personal printer. The ET-4850 is packed with features. It isn't perfect, but executes exceptionally in many departments. The most important aspect is how does it perform with print jobs? Print jobs finished in a timely manner and with great color even for double-sided printing. Scanning produced high quality images, and the document feeder worked as normal. This Epson printer is very robust in connectivity with Wi-Fi capabilities, ethernet port, and USB cable option. Unfortunately, you're not supplied with a USB cord or ethernet cable, but they're inexpensive items. One desire is for the printer to handle photo printing better. This is not intended for that functionality, but the ET-4850 is very close to being the last printer you will ever want to buy for your home.",2 months ago
558,559,6470011,vrs99,4,Full On All-in-One in Small Footprint,"Especially capable ink printer with a small footprint that will be right at home in many spaces and roles. In any application where space may be limited the Epson ET-4850 will be good option for an All-in-One (copy, scan, fax, print). Can see the ET-4850 in a student’s dorm room, at home, and in offices.

Strong point is the cartridge free high-capacity ink reservoir system which is stated to provide up to 7500 black pages and 6000 color. That is a remarkable amount of printing from one ink reservoir fill. Concerned that by adding ink to the printer could be messy, far from it, it is as simple as it gets and not a drop is leaked. Filling the reservoirs, the first time required about ten minutes.

Document printing is striking quality suitable for professional correspondence, student papers, resumes, essays and for quick everyday prints. Photo printing is brilliant.

559,560,6470011,TechMatcher,4,Very capable multi-function printer,"Just received the ET-4850 multi-function printer and opened it immediately to setup it up. Setup took about 30 minutes using the Epson Smart Panel app on my iphone. It walked me right through it from filling tanks to WiFi with no problems.

Filling the ink tanks was a breeze - hard to believe just how easy it was and how much it can reduce future costs of ink! Great job Epson.

Print setup was easy as well - ran through the adjustments and tweaked a few settings with no issues. Print quality looks good for normal document printing. Photo printing was very good - especially using photo paper.

Scanning was easy to use, but the initial quality suffered. After playing with the resolution and a few other settings, I have it working better. The document feeder works well too. I used it both scanning and copying - flawless.

I only gave a 4 star rating as I can't seem to find a way to set/retain the default scan save location. I want it to go into the ""My Scans"" folder on my PC.....

The ink for the first time setting up the machine uses about a quarter from the tanks as it charges the lines in the printer. This is pretty much a one time thing unless you run the printer dry. It also pretty quiet vs other printers I have owned in the past. You are able to print via you cell phone and wirelessly on your computer. All in all this is a nice complete package in one unit.,2 months ago
563,564,6470011,Zunderwood,4,A nice home office printer with one shortcoming,"This is not my first Epson Inkjet printer. I’ve had a few of them over the years with my last being a WF-7720. This one, the EcoTank ET-4850, promises to correct an issue prominent in many Inkjet printers – high printer ink costs. In purchasing this unit, Epson provided four bottles of ink: Black, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.

Adding ink to the printer is easy as pie, and as easy as promoted. And the process is quick, perhaps a minute or so per bottle. Epson states that the ink should be sufficient for 2 years’ printing needs, although that’s relative to the kind of printing you do. 

Setting up the printer was also easy. The included documentation had a link to a web-based process that walks you through the installation process. It waits while you install the ink, prompts you to select your local network’s SSID and password, and so on. In about 30-45 minutes, all was up and running.

The ET-4850 can scan, copy, fax, and print. You can use the printer’s small display window to do many of these functions, but the screen is so small that I regularly pressed the wrong icon or entered the wrong letter or number. Seriously, the screen is not geared for people with large fingers, nor for older people who might need larger characters with which to work.

Epson provides apps that run on your phone to perform all functions, as well as downloadable apps for your Windows/Mac systems. I prefer the Windows apps for the majority of work I do. 

The ET-4850 can do both one-sided and two-sided printing. It does both very well and is reasonably fast. For test printing color documents, I have a Word document with three brightly colored bird photos embedded, and the results were surprisingly good. 

To get a good color result on my other printers using plain paper, I had to change the other printer’s respective print driver to reflect high-quality even though I was only using plain paper. Not specifying high-quality caused the color to be blah. And on top of that, the printing slowed down substantially. 

With the ET-4850, however, you can get pretty good color prints using plain paper. For good photo quality prints, replace the paper in the paper tray with something akin to Kodak Premium Picture Paper. Place the glossy side down in the tray, then define to the printer driver the kind of photo paper you’re using, size stock, and portrait/landscape. For our needs, our photo paper is High Glossy, 4x6”, portrait. Printing a photo on the ET-4850 also caused it to print slower, but not as slow as my other printers.

As an aside, the printer comes with a 250-sheet paper tray, which minimizes how frequently you’ll need to add paper.

For faxing, there is a separate Epson Fax app to manage your fax-related phone numbers, as well as tools to ensure that your landline is connected to the printer correctly. Everything related to the faxing process is easy to set up. 

The ET-4850 comes with both a built-in flatbed scanner and an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF). The flatbed scanner worked without any issues. The ADF, not so much!

I scan up to fifty (50) mostly 2-sided documents a month. Since the ADF does NOT do two-sided scanning, the ADF is almost as bad as having to lift the top to get to the flatbed scanner. Place the two-sided document into the ADF and scan the first side, then flip the page over and place it on the ADF for another scan. For me, this defeats the purpose of an ADF.

ADF’s come in many flavors. Some scan the top of the document, then automatically flip the document over and scan the bottom. Others scan both the top and the bottom of the document (duplex) at the same time. And then there’s this ADF, which only scans one side of a document. 

Consider this: my homeowner’s insurance policy is generally 30 pages long. If I want to scan the policy in, I’m going to have to scan the whole document twice. The first pass will scan in the top side of each page, then I’ll need a second pass to scan the bottom of each page. If all pages are double-sided, the policy will scan pages 1, 3, 5 etc. on the first pass, then even numbered pages on the second pass. Fortunately, the Epson Scan 2 app can be set to Edit, which permits me to drag and drop scanned images once the scanning is completed. However, this can be onerous since it is difficult to read the small fonts in Edit mode (even if you expand each page on a 1-by-1 basis). And you’re dealing with 60 images.

Another issue with the ET-4850’s ADF is how easy it gets jammed. I recently scanned in a four (4) page document. Three of the pages were pristine, with no dog ears, staple marks, or previous folds. The fourth page had previously been folded, although I spent to good bit of time ensuring that it was as straight as possible. The ET-4850’s ADF jammed every time on that page. Yet, that same page went through a different printer’s ADF without any problem.

The ADF put a damper on an otherwise nice multifunction printer. For someone who might rarely use the ADF, or scans primarily one-sided documents, and only scans pristine pages, this is a super solution. It prints reasonably fast and does an excellent job printing color photos on photo-grade paper. And of high importance to me, replacement ink is very affordable. 

The ET-4850 would easily be a 5-star solution if not for the ADF. As such, I’m giving it a 4-star rating.",2 months ago
564,565,6470011,Hank,3,Underwhelming at the price point,"Be careful about the glowing reviews for this printer. You will notice that most of them were written by people who received the printer for free, in exchange for a review. Generally when people review a product they didn't pay for they are more forgiving of flaws.

I needed a new home office / family printer when my HP 8600 Pro recently died. That printer made it about 10 years and other than the expensive ink cartridges I had very few complaints about it.

The Epson EcoTank 4850 is positioned at the very top end of what most home users will purchase. I chose this model for the touch screen and the automatic document feeder (ADF). You also get a fax interface on this model which many customers (like myself) probably will never use.

The idea with tank printers is that you will pay more for the printer hardware up front, in this case $500, and pay less for ink. Epson says the ink that comes with the printer should last for two years, and after that, two more years of ink is about $50. 

Certainly if you do a lot of printing, this is more economical than cartridges. I'm sure I spent many hundreds of dollars on the cartridges I put in my HP, but the printer was also only $299 when I bought it.

When I took the 4850 out of the box I could not believe how tiny it was. This is not necessarily a great thing as I'll cover in a moment.

The printer is setup with an app on your phone, using BlueTooth and during the setup it will ask if you want to connect to WiFi. The Epson app seems to work well for the most part and the setup went quite smoothly although the process where you align the print head I thought was more difficult than it needed to be... those test page prints are microscopic and I had to get reading glasses that I almost never use to see the fine lines and choose the best option.

Print quality is okay, but not great, and not as good as on the 10 year old much less expensive HP. Using the Epson app with the default settings the print was very washed out and undersaturated. I had to adjust the settings and turn off color correction and do another print, which looked better, but still not that impressive for a $500 printer. I'm not sure if there is a way to calibrate color on the printer.

Print speed is quite good and the quality for ""fast drafts"" is definitely acceptable.

Most of my criticisms come down to how the printer is constructed and used.

The printer doesn't hold very much paper compared to my old one, and you can't completely remove the cartridge to make loading small photo paper easier. It also sits directly below the output tray, so you often have to move the output tray to get at the paper you are trying to put into the unit. It is not very well thought out at all and everything here seems like it was subject to cost cutting.

The touchscreen is incredibly tiny, much much smaller than the one on my old printer, and it doesn't tilt, so you have to bend over to look at it or squat down in front of it. Terrible!

The automatic document feeder is very flimsy and can't load very many sheets, it is also slow and REALLY noisy. The scanner is similarly very cheap feeling and I'm worried that the scanner door might eventually break based on how it is constructed.

All in all I would rate this printer as just ""okay"". I'm certainly not impressed by it at the price point and based on how flimsy everything feels I am very skeptical it will last as long as my old one.",1 month ago
565,566,6470011,GadgetGuy1981,5,Trouble-free printing without subscriptions!,"For the past several year’s I’ve subscribed to the idea that printing in the home would reduce to an almost non-existent level, and that the subscription-based ink services attached to other brand’s print products were they way to go.

Around that same time, EPSON introduced the EcoTank system. The key advantage here is that the ET series printers don’t require a recurring subscription but carry a MASSIVE amount of low-priced ink, bringing them into the same economic position as their pay-to-print counterparts.

There’s just one difference: While the total cost of ownership (or TCO) is roughly the same, if you print photos or do a good deal of printing, the EcoTank model suits your home better. That diminishing demand on print in my house? It’s never come to fruition. We were struggling to keep our printing under 50pages/month, especially with the kids home from school last year and the Mrs and I both working from home, not to mention that photo projects usually drained the installed ink from our system and required a lengthy wait to resume the project while we awaited our next shipment.

The ET-4850 is one of the higher-end EcoTank models, boasting a large paper tray, auto-document feeder, and a good scanner. It handles two-sided printing with ease, and has a smaller footprint than most other printers with its feature set.

Prints are fast in both B&W and color, and printing is relatively quiet, though the start of a job is as loud as any other inkjet.

These EcoTank printers have another advantage that I haven’t utilized. It’s apparently easy to swap the stock ink for Dye Sublimation ink for making T-shirt transfers and other crafts. There are lots of guidance online for this, but please be advised that EPSON only supports (and warranties) the device with its own ink.

In the end I’m telling friends and family that print a significant amount (or do ANY photo work) to switch to tank-based solutions, I’m glad I did.",2 months ago
566,567,6470011,Panther68,5,Epson Greatly Improves Their EcoTank Product Line,"UNBOXING & INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:
When I got the ET-3710 slightly more than two years ago, I chided them on their failure in eco-friendly packaging, as they continued to use an excessive amount of Styrofoam & plastic. They’re STILL bad…but, they have improved, albeit fairly minorly. WHY Epson continues to fall WAY behind other manufacturers, I do not know. On the ‘plus’ side, at least the ET-4850 appears to be a considerable improvement over the two-year-old lined. There are now far fewer buttons, and a touch-screen for accessing everything. There are still a few buttons, but some (such as the ‘Power’ button) are necessary. As with almost all printers these days, USB and/or Ethernet cables are NOT included…so, I won’t hold this against them.

SETUP:
Setup keeps getting easier & easier. There’s still a lot of blue tape needing to be removed, but the rest (plug in the power cord, fill the ink tanks, turn the printer on, “charge” the print system, & run through the multi-step print head alignment process) is mostly the same…with one considerable exception. Previously, the ‘setup’ and ‘print head alignment’ procedures were done from the printer, itself. Now, all of that is done through an app that you must first download/install on a mobile device (cell phone, or tablet). Thankfully, there are Android & iOS versions. Once the printer is set up, and the alignment process is complete, you then go through connecting the printer to your wired/wireless network. After that’s complete, you can finally go through the usual software/driver installation on your computers.

PRINT QUALITY:
With the ET-3710, I (slightly) complained about the print quality, saying “While not the best print quality, it is far from the worst”. I am here to tell you that, over the past two years, Epson has GREATLY improved their EcoTank printers. I don’t know if they’ve made improvements to the ink, improvements to the print head, improvements to the software/drivers, or a combination of all of these…whatever Epson did, I’m impressed with the end results. Text is considerably sharper, colors appear brighter, and there’s no longer a “washed out” appearance to photos (compared to the ET-3710 from two years ago).

ADDITIONAL INFO:
One change (between the ET-3710 & ET-4850) I need to point out is the automatic sheet feeder. When it came to scanning, one thing I never liked was that the ET-3710 could only scan one page at a time, and each page had to be manually placed on the flatbed scanner. With the new ET-4850, while you can still scan pages one-at-a-time, you also have the option of using the auto sheet feeder. This, alone, made it a very worthy upgrade.

FINAL VERDICT:
If you’ve never tried an ink tank-based printer, I’m thinking it’s about time you did. I can’t speak on the quality of other brand’s versions, but, in regards to Epson’s line of EcoTank printers, the improvements over the past two years makes it a VERY worthwhile choice. I will not list any ‘exceptions’ (where I would usually say “yes” for some people, and “no” for others. Hands-down, I give an unequivocable “yes” to the question of whether, or not, I would recommend this. While the old ET-3710 will now be given to my parents, the ET-4850 is now sitting on my printer and, right next to my HP LaserJet Pro…and, I am EXTREMELY happy with it.

567,568,6470011,MemphisTechieRN,5,Keeps improving. Meets expectations!,"As an owner of a previous model of ""ecotank"" printer, I am pleased to see this line continue - with improvements!

If you have never owned one before, you are in for a treat! 

You will not have to buy ink for two years (or more) because of the adoption of a self-contained ""tank"" system. Simply fill the tanks up with the provided ink, and BAM, you are set for 24 months of lovely, full color printing and copying! The quality is outstanding. Photo printing (on photo paper, glossy, matte, card stock - I have tried them all!) brings you vivid, crisp images. The text on documents is just as crisp.

The 4850 is certainly a stylish item, with the ability to print, copy, and scan. The auto document feeder comes in handy for when you have a stack of (up to 250!) pages to scan or copy. It has yet to jam on me, and I have given it a torture test of various paper types. What is a game changer in this department for me is that it does auto 2-sided printing. No more ""did I turn the paper the proper way"" thoughts will have to cross your mind. 

You can control virtually all of the 4850's functions via its 2.4 color touchscreen. I have giant fingers, and it still did what I poked at, and did not register any false (giant finger) errors. What's more, using this in an office that has windows where the sun (it seems) comes in 24/7 - there is no glare from the touchscreen.

The 4850 also brings (easy to set up) connection options. Obviously, LAN is the easiest. Windows and Fedora (Linux) recognized it instantly. Same with the wireless connection option. Though, just for personal reasons, I prefer to use the LAN connection option as it fits my setup and use-case (office) better.

And that is not all! (Sounding a bit like an infomercial - not intentional!!!!!) you can print via your phones and tabs via the ""Epson Smart Panel"" app. This app is fantastic for those late night ""I want to print this out, but I don't want to have to pull it up on my PC"" moments. No connectivity issues with this either. 

So, if the thought of getting an impressive printer, by an awesome company which allows you (along with the already pointed out impressive features) to print for 2 years without having to change cartridges sounds right up your alley.... Then the 4850 is right for you.

If not (and I cannot think of a single reason why NOT), go ahead and buy that other brand's slightly less expensive offering. In the same two years you could have been like me, and not had to change an ink cartridge; you will have had to change close to one hundred cartridges', in comparison, in your 2 years. 

Do the math! Not only is the math on your side, but so is the environment. You have just saved one hundred ink cartridges', residual ink, and the usual wasteful packaging from such from entering landfills. If everyone adopted ecotank systems, it would be a good start!

Get the 4850 (you know you wanted to anyway. Or you would not have read this far).",3 months ago
568,569,6470011,MischiefOW,5,Economical Solution to a Tank sized problem,"I like to get straight to the point. The printers that have come out recently are changing the printing game. Where office printers were big and bulky, this one offers a hybridized approach to this issue. 

I downloaded the Epson app and it walked me through setup from start to finish. It was quite fast I might add.
(Remember, as a general rule of thumb always reset your routers if it won’t connect to the internet or after your printer is connected. In my opinion it fixes a lot of recurring connectivity issues that I’ve had with most of my printers.)

You get a substantially large number of copies or prints produced whether black or color (7000 for black and around 6000 for color). All this varies obviously on the content of what you are printing. I remember back in high school where we would have to buy the extremely expensive cartridges for the super slow jet printers. Fast forward ten years and the advancements are indeed Economical and PRACTICAL. 

I can’t begin to explain how long I’ve waited for the printer market to be more viable for people like me. I say this because I’m a reader. I can’t sit in front of a screen and absorb information the way I would if I had it printed in front of me. I’m currently pursuing a career that weirdly; printers have made so much easier. Great quality, speed, and sustainability lead to practicality and thus I can use it everyday (which I have).

It’s not a small printer so I’d say make a nice little nook for this tank to help you out. I’ve printed recipes, DIY instructions, copied important information and digitized it. The quality is absolutely immaculate. The app is easy to use and I love this thing. Must have for any student, teacher, or if you just want a printer that fits the ""ten year workhorse that doesn't stop"". This is a feature that we all look for in a printer when we go shopping because at this price tag, it seems a bit steep. I can attest, the juice is worth the squeeze. What you spend in the printer you make up for in Ink savings. I highly recommend this printer.",2 months ago
569,570,6470011,UncleBrenty,3,Too Much Is More Than Enough,"Epson - EcoTank ET-4850 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer has way too much going on but I can't justify the price. I've been really curious about printers that claim to do so many things like copy, scan, print, fax (really, it actually still has a fax) and more. Printer is only 14.8 inches wide, 13.7 inches deep and 9.1 inches high but seems bulkier. It has a large 250 sheet paper tray that has adjustable sides but not length, 2.4 inch touchscreen (a bit small for my fingers), pullout output tray, smartphone app, etc.....Document feeder on top folds out if you want to copy or scan a stack of pages but good luck getting a steady feed. Mine likes to not pull in the paper even though it shows loaded on the touch screen so I get a blank scan or copy on the first try. For just one page it is easier to just open the lid and put your document on the glass but it aligns in the front corner which is the opposite of every printer I have ever used. Paper tray sometimes feeds two blank sheets through when I print then tells me the paper tray is empty (?) 

Ink bottles (Epson size 502) drain into a tank hidden under the scanner lid and show in windows on the front of the printer. Four starter bottles are included. Amazing how they automatically release when placed on the posts and the ink fills into the tanks. Not a drip or spill so installation was no mess.
Claims that one bottle is equal to 90 cartridges (6500 pages Black and White and 5200 pages Color). I've been printing both B&W and Color and quality is good and colors accurate. 

Tried to set up printer using the link from the QR code but halfway through it lost connection to my iPhone sitting next to the printer and kept wanting to ""retry after moving closer to the printer"". Never worked and I ended up completing setup manually. This printer includes an installation CD as well and if you don't have a reader in your computer like my newer laptop you can use the Epson website. Unfortunately, the CD loaded so many Epson programs and options on my older laptop I had to delete some to free up space. WiFi only sees my 2.4 Ghz but works on my 5G (?) USB and Ethernet ports available for a wired connection.
No manual just a foldout brochure with the CD and instructions inside the box lid. User Guide installs on your computer during setup from the CD or website.

Printer is fast (15.5 pages per minute B&W, 8.5 ppm Color) but also noisy so you may want to put it away from your desk and go get printouts and get your steps in.
Scan resolution up to 1200 by 2400 dpi/ppp. Print resolution up to 4800 by 1200 dpi/ppp. 
Printer will go to sleep after use but white ring power button is always on. Can't find a setting to make that turn off.

I prefer the Epson Smart Panel on my iPhone for most uses. You can Print Documents, Scan, Document Capture (Scan with Camera App), Copy, Make a Preset Copy (still not sure what that does), Clean Printheads, watch Video Manuals, Troubleshoot and more. You can also monitor the 4 ink tanks. I don't think this printer monitors my ink usage like my other one to send more when it detects that I am low.

This model printer really does seem made for a home office that has medium to high usage with so many functions and too many programs for my home computer.
I'm going to uninstall more of them and operate it from the iPhone app and control panel while I learn to use all the settings.
Unfortunately the printer construction is plastic on plastic on plastic so durability may be limited for heavy use and doesn't justify the price.

570,571,6470011,yogabear,5,Easy Setup Great Form Factor,"This printer is easy to setup and promises lower ink prices by skipping the cartridges and using bottles of ink. I must say I was a little concerned with the first fill as you need to remove the cap on the bottle and invert it. Well, my fears were misplaced as the design kept every drop in the bottle until it was time to empty into the appropriate reservoir. Each is ""keyed"" so you cant mix them up which is really nice. 

Print quality is very good. I tested all manor of prints from reports, graphs and photos with plain, high gloss and photo paper. All turned out great. The ability to print double sided is wonderful to save paper and also give a professional touch to reports etc. 

The form factor is smaller than my last printer with similar features but one thing I really like is the slide out tray to receive the printed material. It is more substantial and gives full support of the sheet. Something I have often complained about on other printers, but not here. 

Set up was fast and I had everything working in under 5 minutes.

571,572,6470011,RobWLINY2,5,Inkjet that may convert me from Laser,"This is one of the highest priced inkjet printers I have owned, my initial impression is it may be worth it. The (android, in my case) app portion of setup is super easy, in a chat-like form, it steps you through everything and you can scroll if you missed something. Ink is brainless (easy) to install once the app shows where to do it. Most of bottle was used each time, maybe there was a few drops left. Also, during on-printer touch screen setup, note that the panel tilts out for easy reading, important if you're setting up near floor level as I was. During alignment it's worth stating the numbers with the ""#"" are the step numbers, those without ""#"" are choices - initially I found that confusing. A firmware update is installable after setup, I can only say so far that the firmware updated didn't seem to do damage.

The menu on printer display once the setup is complete is very simple and uncomplicated.

I printed a photo (from android Epson app) on 8.5x11 setting, the color was true to original, it came out of printer reasonably fast, and it printed to the very edge of the paper (there was no 'white space' at edge). It was, to my eyes, at least as sharp on paper as it was on phone sceen, though paper was blown up larger.

While 2 sided printing worked fine from Microsoft Word on a PC... Printing a PDF (restaurant menu) from android with two-sided printing selected, it printed the whole document one-sided which was not great. This is likely an android driver issue which an update could fix, so I won't count it against the printer.

Even though I use a standalone scanner for daily scanning, the flat-bed scanner here will prove useful (for example licenses and photos). The document feeder is more useful to me when I would fax, I have confidence that the fax works fine (I've had other Epson printers, and don't suspect they broke it). I do not fax too often, though. I almost wanted to make a joke about the included CD, but like having a fax, including drivers as an option (for those who don't want to connect to net and download for whatever reason), can be important.

At the cost of ink, this may convert me away from laser finally. That's even if I did buy brand name ink.",2 months ago
572,573,6470011,Adams2,5,Impressed with this inkjet printer.,"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the printer.  I agree with most of the reviews on here.  The LCD screen is small and wish it were bigger.  The upfront cost is expensive but hope the low cost of the ink will make up for that. Those two are my negatives.  

This printer replaced an HP OfficeJet 8600 Series printer. Toner on the HP was $100 and the ink dried in the cartridge if it wasn't being used for a few days.

I like the size of the printer. It's smaller than the HP that I had. Prints faster than my old HP but not as fast as the monochrome B&W Samsung laser printer. Set up was easy and had no issues updating the firmware or software.  No issues with printing and scanning. Read the other reviews and there is a consensus about this printer. 

I'm glad I purchased this inkjet over the color laser (Cannon MF743Cdw) that I went to purchase.",1 week ago
573,574,5848300,rcboater,4,Need to leave paper door open to print!,"After lots of shopping around, reading reviews, etc. I settled on this printer as having the best balance of size, features, and toner costs.  Since getting it two months ago,  I’ve scanned several items, and printed maybe 2 dozen pages.   As such a low volume user, this Canon replaced a functional HP all-in-one inkjet that was wasting (expensive) ink cartridges because they kept drying out.

PROs:  
- Print quality
- higher scan resolution than many in its class
-  easy printing from an ipad. My wife can send a recipe from her ipad and will print double-sided if requested.

CONs:
- Weak WIFI setup documentation. I found other owners complaints about the setup instructions to be valid.  The doc is poorly organized, vague in places, incomplete in others.  Fortunately, a web search will find reviews and other articles with tips.
- You have to leave the paper door open to print. Nowhere in ANY of the reviews I read (nor in the documentation) was this ever mentioned.  Every home printer I’ve owned over the last 30 years has had the usual paper tray that you pull open, load, and close- but not this one.  For a very low volume home user, this is an unexpected annoyance, to have to load paper every time I want to print.

593,594,6450665,Daved,5,Great printer for small office with few trade offs,"I work out of a home office and, while I don't run through stacks of paper a month, I have periods where I need to print quite a bit in one go. More so, I have a need to scan stacks of documents regularly, so I find great use with document feeders. For my office needs I currently employ a HP OfficeJet 8600 Plus. Until I tested the OfficeJet Pro 9025.

First thing, out of the box, this printer is bright, bearing a slight resemblance to the 7000 series OfficeJets with a two-tone color scheme of white and grey. The middle of the body is white, capped off with a grey lower paper tray and grey document feeder on top. It's a much sharper appearance than the grey/brown of the 6000 and 8000 series printers. Additionally, the design language is much sharper and more modern, foregoing the rounded, sometimes ""bubbly"" design language of the 8000 series in favor of boxier lines and 90 degree angles. It's very square and rectangular, and even features a flat top to the document feeder, which has historically carried a more rounded apperance. 

The new design language is very appealing, and seems more focused on function than form. It has a very purposeful, functional, and professional appearance to it. It also lends a more slimmed down look to the printer, which makes sense given that the overall box is indeed slimmed down by several inches. My 8600 was purchased because it supported fax, printing, scanning and copying, 2-sided printing, and a document feeder on top, but the machine is bulky and heavy. The 9025 manages to squeeze all this in to a smaller package, indicating some nice internal design efficiencies. While you don't move a printer around all that often once it's setup, moving between the 8600 Plus to the 9025 reveals quite a difference in weight. 

In size, the 9025 is the same height as the 8600 Plus, but squeezes a second paper tray into that space, and maintaining the same capabilities with the document feeder. Front to back and side to side, however, the 9025 bests the 8600 Plus by quite a bit. My 8600 Plus shared a desktop with my photo printer, and had only 19.5"" wide and 20.25"" deep to fit in. Because of the printer size, it had to face perpendicular to my other printer, with the output tray kept in most of the time to avoid bumping it. The 9025 fits facing parallel to my other printer with room to spare, and even with the output tray adding 6"" to the depth, only sticks out .375"" at the front. 

To accomplish this, it appears HP made some internal changes to the printer, stacking things a bit taller and further back in the box. The output tray sits a bit higher and a bit recessed into the case, and fits 2 paper trays beneath it compactly. The doc feeder on top also seems slimmed down a bit, allowing it to fit in the more compact design. The only issue I really have is with the power cord placement. If it were offset a bit, or even if HP included a right-angle cord, this printer could sit even further back. 

I do believe some sacrifices were made to accomplish the smaller and lighter design, and after playing with it for about 2 weeks now, I think it's apparent in the feel of some of the materials. 

First, the plastic on the 9025 feels more flexible and thinner than the 8600. When I open and close the doc feeder cover I feel like I am about to break it. This contrasts the 8600 which uses a latch to open and close, and feels better. Additionally, the overall feel of the 9025 is more plasticky than the 8600, and leads to some question of durability under heavier use or in environments with multiple people using it daily. 

Second, the print head has a spongy and less reassuring feeling when inserting printer cartridges. With the 8600 there is a tactile feel to the cartridges clicking into place, letting you know they seated properly. With the 9025 I found myself checking the cartridge a couple times to make sure it was in all the way. They also made squeaky sounds when I inserted and removed them, and though that might go away with time, it has not yet. 

They also sacrificed on the screen size with this model, opting for a smaller screen that is just over 1.5"" tall and 2"" wide, where the 8600 was about double the width. With all the features and apps being added to these printers, the screen size is really important, and I think this one is just too small for it's purpose. They also have a swipe down from the top feature to access settings and information, similar to a smart phone, and this menu is more challenging to read on the smaller screen. I do like the new mechanics for adjusting the screen angle, which doesn't require a button pinch of press, like my 8600, but I also believe this might be the reason for a little bit of movement when interacting with the screen. At first I thought there was a slight click action or sound when pressing a button on the screen, but it appears to just be the screen moving a bit under pressure. 

Moving beyond the look and feel of the new printer, from a performance perspective it does very well. Setting it up out of the box was really easy, thanks to the HP Smart software guiding through setup. Additionally, you can use the HP Smart app on your phone to setup the printer via bluetooth. I did run into issues connecting to the printer from just under 6 feet away, and found it woked best standing 2 feet or less in front of it. 

Once ink is inserted, the printer primes the cartridges, and I noticed it to be a bit quieter than the 8600 Plus, but also a bit higher pitched. My 8600 had a more mechanical sound to it when priming new cartridges, but I don't think this indicates any issues or performance problems. 

What was indicative of a change, though, was the sound and action when the printer wakes to print. The 8600 makes a loud, mechanical sound when it wakes to warm up, and takes a noticeably longer amount of time than the 9025. In contrast, the 9025 is quick and relatively quiet when waking to copy or print. Additionally, the 9025 is quieter during normal operation as well, whether printing, scanning, or copying, even on the document feeder. 

I found the print quality of the 9025 to be really good as well, providing crisp and clean colors, as well as sharp text, which my photo printer does not do so well with. I would still use my photo printer for high quality photo prints, since the color depth and quality of photos is great than the OfficeJet printers produce. That said, I have always found the OfficeJet printers to handle text prints very well, and the 9025 continues that trend. Running through a copy test, however, revealed some areas for improvement with the 9025. Using the standard HP test print, I copied on both the 8600 and 9025, and the 8600 seemed to provide a cleaner copy, producing sharper edges and slightly better color. Both printers struggled with the grey text at the base of the sheet, though, with the 8600 barely able to present something identifiable as text, and the 9025 providing only marginally better results. With the higher contrasting text both did fine, so it seems to be a struggle point with the lower contrast of the grey. 2 sided printing was also easy and clean, though speed of that did not seem noticeably faster than the 8600. I tried to capture some of the differences in print quality in one of the images I added, but it might be difficult to completely see them.

One BIG thing I have been avoiding with the HP printers is the subscription ink plan. My fluctuation in usage means it won't really benefit me, and I am also not a fan of subscription services tied to my daily business needs. The ink being delivered as needed with Instant Ink is a cool idea, but I don't like the idea of HP tracking what I print, or making it more difficult for me to print if I decide to use a 3rd party cartridge. I have also read some issues with customer service around the subscription, with people having difficulty canceling, or getting potentially overcharged due to peak printing periods. I did decide to sign up for a trial of it through the website, and while I can see my usage and plan info, I haven't used it enough in the past 2 weeks to be able to review the service yet.

Overall, I like this printer very much and am going to give it a shot as a daily replacement for my 8600 PLus, which is a big step for me. The compact size is a HUGE benefit for my office space, especially with it still including 2-sided printing, a doc feed, and the 2 paper trays. I wish the screen were about double the size, and I wish the feel of the plastic on it didn't feel as flexible or flimsy as it does. Because of those issues I want to drop half a star off the rating, but I still think this is a fine machine for someone who has a home business or work-from-home office that needs these features. Because I can't drop a half star, and I don't think it warrants 4 stars, I am leaving it as 5. It's fast, quiet, compact, light, and very functional, and I think it's definitely worth strong consideration.",2 years ago
594,595,6450665,MVilla,5,Great printer for nearly heavy duty office work,"Printer came in to which I measure a 19x15x19 inch box, well padded and everything so the printer inside stays safe during transport. 

Of course the printer outside the box itself, the footprint is 17” x 13”, and about 12” high I believe. 

This printer is best if it’s sat on its own small table or perhaps on a dresser, or average nightstand. I have mines on the far left of my corner desk where my desktop computer is on and it barely fits; the upper shelving of my desk will get in the way when it comes to opening the scanner lid. I can remove the shelving or, set this elsewhere where there is room (like it’s own small table). Just be sure to have enough space. This is not your usual short or compact desk jet printer. 

Of course I followed the instructions in the correct order; installing the ink was tricky. When opening the compartment door, and installing the ink, I made sure I pressed everything all the way in, and by the diagram there illustrates a click icon. 

There wasn’t much of a noticeable click, but a soft one. Closed the compartment door, then I get an error of a “print head” missing and to correct or reinstall the ink. 

I uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and finally got it to work. 

I did all the setting up of the printer through the HP smart app, and everything works well and printed out a test page, and other stuff (resumes and coupons). Fine print quality and impressive overall over the previous older deskjet printer I have (which is also HP). 

And I’m all printing wirelessly over WiFi. It’s visible on my phone, tablet, and desktop and laptop computer. 

The paper loading tray is easy to use to reload paper, and I’m sure the ink will last longer through more printing until comes the time to replace. 

I believe this HP printer is a great investment and, from a standpoint this looks to be an office machine, either good for work in an office setting or casual work done from home (homework, photos, etc).",2 years ago
595,596,6450665,Cipher469,4,A Pro Document Printer/Scanner/Copier,"With a few exceptions, the Pro9025e is an excellent choice for printing, scanning, and copying. Except for one important function, it is the best OfficeJet I have seen from HP in quite a while. The merits and demerits are:
*SETUP: Once you have loaded the app onto your computer, setup should only take a few minutes. My experience, however, was not a positive one, and I believe it was due to a glitch in the software. Every time the setup process got to the point of connecting to my mesh wi-fi, setup failed because there was no place to enter my network password. No matter what I tried, the same result was experienced. About to lose my religion, I shut it down and walked away. The next day I tried again and had two failures. On the third attempt, the password entry page opened and then quickly went away. Another attempt got to the entry page and, thankfully, stayed on screen so I could enter the password. The ink cartridges loaded easily, and all was a go.
*PRINTING: Document printing is a breeze! Set your parameters, press print, and your document is ready in seconds. Quality is clear and clean. In addition, if you need two-sided printing, the Pro9025e handles that job like a champ. Ink is quick-dried, as it should be. In fact, it can print 2 sides in the time some other printers take to print one. 
Photo printing is a different story. I have yet to find an All-in-One HP that prints photos well, and this one is awful. Prints are not sharp, there are broken white lines across photo, and very wet ink. I intended to scan and attach examples, but, after 24 hours, they are still wet. So, the attachments are photos of the printed wet photos. If, however, you have no plan to print photos, don’t let this issue deter you from considering this excellent printer for documents only.
*SCANNING: One of my peeves with HP all-in-ones previously is no duplex scanning, but the 9020e not only can duplex, but it is also much quicker than others that I have experience with. The first scan was a WOW moment. Great improvement HP!
*COPYING: Copies fast and well. Easy duplexing is another plus.

Apart from the awful photo printing, the 9025e is an excellent machine. With that caveat, I would recommend it.",7 months ago
596,597,6450665,DrWrightFitbit,4,HP not reliable lately (3 printers in one year)!!!,this was excellent until it became defective a week before he warranty ended. HP customer service trouble shoot and stated they would send another in October and never did. I just ordered he HP OfficePro 8025e and it wont work in color nor will it scan from top feeder. Now two weeks later Im going to buy a 3rd HP Printer from Best Buy,2 weeks ago
597,598,6450665,SteveC,5,Excellent SOHO printer,"We already have a 90 series HP printer but we wanted one with more features as ours didn’t have automatic dual sided printing and scanning. Once we saw that HP had the 9025e with all the features we wanted we had to grab one.

Unboxing:
The printer comes really well boxed sitting in cradled in Styrofoam corners. Once the top ones were removed it was simple to grab the two handles of the protective bag the printer was in and lift it out of the box. About the simplest larger sized printer unboxing I’ve done. Inside the box is the printer, cartridges, power cable and documentation. The printer itself is pretty large “a good bit over our old one” and you’ll need a good spot to set it up.

Setting up:
Like our other HPs we’ve had before we just placed the printer where we wanted it, plugged in the power cord. I wanted this to be hardwired on our network and there’s a switch right next to it that’s connected to our router. There’s an orange plastic plug in the Ethernet port located on the back below the phone jacks. You have to remove that plug to connect your Ethernet connection. I use a Obi VOIP box for our phone and fax so I hooked the main line from the Obi to the Tel line in on the back also.

After hooking up power the printer was powered up and gave instructions about inserting the ink cartridges so we did that. Inserting the cartridges is very straight forward, each is color coded and you just push them in till they click into place. The printer, after going through the new cartridge setup asked to print an alignment page which I let it do and then placed that page in the scanner and let it scan the page and finish the alignment. 

The printer has a small LCD full color touch screen just like our old model and can be tilted for a better viewing angle, it’s used to manually preform scans/faxing/copying and adjust all the settings. There are a lot of options in the menus on the screen and you’ll want to familiarize yourself with those functions and settings but for the most part you can set up everything from the apps.

All our computers are Windows based and phones are Android so well be referencing only those operating systems. I already had the HP Smart app installed on our computers so it was easy enough to go into that and have it set up a new printer. If you don’t currently have the HP Smart app installed then you will need to use the Windows Play store to download and install it. The Windows app is pretty straight forward and has a simple interface for what you want to do.

This printer also has Wi-Fi built in but since we’ve placed it near a router that option probably won’t be used, at least not yet.

Use:
I have to say this is one fast inkjet printer, printing documents is lightning fast and there’s barely any warm up time. Text is crisp and clear and colors turn out very vibrant even when using cheap 20lb paper “that’s the paper used in the attached picture”. I also wanted to try out the scanner to check out copy quality and was amazed how fast it copied a color magazine cover. I set the detail on high and from start to finish it scanned and printed a full color copy in 28seconds, “that’s fast for a color inkjet”. The copy of the magazine in some areas came out clearer and in the original cover, especially the motorcycle helmet and how the colors stand out.

We’ve printed multiple documents and some photos and the most noticeable difference from our older 1st gen 90 series model is this one is way faster. The 9025e also has two paper trays so you can either double up your paper stock or have two different types “copy paper/photo paper, or copy paper/envelopes”. The upper tray “#2” already has the guides set up for envelopes which makes it very convenient if you are printing letters and want to include the envelope printing at the same time.

I’ve also installed the HP Smart app on our phones, and after setting up the HP account so the printer can be accessed anywhere I tried printing a couple PDF documents, “worked perfectly” and a picture of a Hibiscus plant in our back yard, well the picture looks like it was professionally printed and you can’t make out any lines in the print from the inkjet process. I even used non HP brand generic glossy photo paper “loaded into the top tray” for this and the results were excellent, “you can see the attached photo of the magazine cover and flower” although you really have to see in person how well these came out.

We don’t send or receive many faxes but it’s a nice option to have when needed. I did a test fax to a friend of ours fax machine and it worked perfect even with using a VOIP box “which can be tricky at times” and he was able to send it back without a hitch.

Conclusion:
With HP+ and the automatic ink refills for 6 months I know we are going to be doing a lot more printing than normal. Their plans start reasonably cheap “around $5 a month” you get 100 pages a month “more than we usually print”, and there are plans that get down to $0.99 a month if you are a light printer. The maximum plan for $25 gets you 700 pages per month, which should be enough for a SOHO or everyday small office. And in the end, instead of a cartridge running out during an important print, the printer will have HP sent out cartridges as soon as they start to get low, “can’t beat that if you are like me and always forget to order cartridges”

With the speed this printer prints at and the convenience of being able to print/scan both sides automatically this printer has filled in all the gaps that were missing “and features we wanted” from our old printer. So if you are looking for a full featured printer that can print, scan, copy, and fax this is going to be the AIO printer for you.",7 months ago
598,599,6450665,Mark,5,Perfect printer for home,"This HP printer is better than those tri color cartridges. More ink and faster printing. Double sided scan and print and also has fax.  Bulk ink tank printers are great if you print constantly but most home users will experience clogged print heads. 
For me this is the best choice for home and small office use",1 month ago
599,600,6450665,ghirsh02,5,A solid workhorse,"I have been using HP Inkjet printers for years and have been fairly satisfied with the performance and quality of their printers. I currently own a Officejet Pro 8710 printer and love it. Having never seen the HP OfficeJet Pro 9025 All-in One printer as it was sent to me as a pre-release item to be reviewed, I was expecting to see another version of my 8710, but this printer was altogether different looking. I has a much more business like appearance similar to the HP Officejet Pro 7740.

Setup was fairly straightforward. After removing the packing materials and powering on the printer, I opened the front and installed the ink cartridges. I downloaded the HP Smart app to my phone following the included instructions. Evidently this printer is so new that you have to download a new, yet to be released version of the smart app. From the software you select add a printer and the app walks you through the process. Within 10 minutes, the printer was up and running. The display asked me to do a scanner alignment which first prints an alignment document which you place on the scanning bed. The small screen prompts you to continue and quickly performs it’s alignment.

Now for the specs: 

Much like any decent all-in-one, the HP Officejet Pro 9025 can print, copy, scan and FAX. It prints up to 24 ppm black, up to 20 PPM Color. This beats my Officejet Pro 8710 by 2 pages per minute. It can do 2 sided copy and scan and has optical character recognition capability. It also has two 250-sheet input trays which is excellent (my 8710 only has 1. The output tray can hold up to 100 sheets. Based on these specs, it seems more equipped for heavy duty office work rather than occasional home office use. My one gripe is the 2.75” screen (I had to measure it diagonally since the spec wasn’t listed in the printer setup materials or on the box). The screen seems small and it is a little hard to read at certain angles. 

Performance wise it did very well. I know it is only 2 PPM faster than my current printer, but it seemed a lot faster. It also seemed a lot mor sturdy while printing without the swaying my 8710 seems to do when printing lines of text. As expected, the print quality is excellent, both in black and white and color. Litter to know bleeding occurred even when printing a photo on regular printer paper.

This printer is also “Instant Ink” ready. HP Instant ink is a plan you can sign up for that charges a fee based on the number of pages you print each month. The printer sends ink level information to HP, and when the printer runs low on ink, replacement ink cartridges are shipped to you. You do not need to purchase replacement ink cartridges from retail stores when you are enrolled in HP Instant Ink. I have never signed up for this service, but I can see it being good if you do a lot of printing.

I am very impressed with the quality and performance of the HP Officejet Pro 9025. Since it is not a released product as of this review I have no idea what it costs, so I can’t give an opinion on it’s value proposition is, but it is a solid performer.",2 years ago
600,601,6450665,CustomerReview,5,HP OfficeJet Pro 9025e,This purchase (OfficeJet Pro) fulfills my needs for quality printing and scanning. The blue-tooth technology not only provides ease of use but the convenience of printing from multiple devices.,1 month ago
601,602,6450665,TechBuyer,5,The Best AIO for the Price,"HP has always been a strong competitor in the AIO market and the OfficeJet Pro has always been near the top of the line.

Its a larger unit but still small enough to fit on a printer hutch, in a corner of a small home office, but large enough to handle a solid amount of auto-feed scanning, a full A4 on the scanning glass, and half a ream of paper in the printer tray.

A few years ago HP made their printers Smart enabled literally with their HP Smart app. This has been good and bad in my opinion. For mobile devices on the same wireless SSID it makes printing simple, but for wired devices or multiple mesh network SSIDs (ISP and home mesh) or connected to different routers, this can be a bit of a nightmare if you don't know how to port forward or bridge different IP ranges across multiple routers. Anyways, that's a different story to tackle.

Overall an AIO is an amazing device, it will make previously tedious paperwork, printing, scanning, documenting much less tedious. Its amazing for anyone running a Small Office or Home Office, anyone who does a lot of online sales and shipping, and it is an absolute lifesaver when it comes to major life transactions like buying a house. The combination of being able to scan, print and upload directly documents directly from your computer is an amazing time saver and probably a big reason places like Kinkos no longer exist.

In terms of set-up, I highly recommend using the wireless setup. I wasn't able to get the printer detected using the LAN. Make sure whatever device you use to set-up is on the same SSID and VLAN if you have multiple. Also, for any windows based devices like laptops and desktops, once you've setup with your phone and the mobile HP Smart App, you can very easily just add the printer via IP.

I previously had the HP OfficeJet Pro 9025 and the 9025e looks to be an incremental improvement with slightly faster printing and scanning. The touchscreen also seems to be more responsive, but otherwise the two units look identical. I will end up moving the 9025 upstairs and connecting it to a different wireless SSID so we have better coverage and flexibility in the house. Great to see the 962 is the same cartridge system being used.

Lastly, this printer includes 6 months of HP+ which is a subscription ink program that offers free ink in the first 6 months and 1 year additional warranty. You really want to see how much you actually print, but for our household we typically don't print that much, especially in color, so we probably won't keep the subscription. If you print a lot however, this could be a really handy feature.

Overall, you can't go wrong with these HP AIO and this is best-in-class and does not burn through ink as fast as previous lower-end units I owned did. Definitely recommend at this price point for the features, performance, and ease of use!",7 months ago

Easy Access to Printer assemblies for paper jams
Laser ink Jet Cartridges are cheap

Cons:

::Setup / Install::
The setup and install of the printer was fairly easy, you can configure from the color touchscreen or the phone app. Also if you wish to install via the computer you will need to go to HP site to download the software to run. It does not come with any software packaged, you need to either go online or use the phone store app to grab.

::Print Quality::
Printing text based documents, scanned item (Non Picture), booklets are very fast and quality is decent. Decent due to some font styles appear incorrectly when printing. It is also very noisy to be sure not to print during odd hours of the night. Pictures come out faded, low quality and inaccurate color saturation. More then likely due to the limitations of a laser based versus inkjet ink cartridges. This printer is definitely meant for someone who prints documents on standard font styles and need large quantities printer.

Overall I would recommend this for anyone who is looking to print large amount of documents in a short time. The cartridges are cheap and great for text based prints. However if looking to print anything graphical, avoid this printer and go with another printer. The quality is very low / average, passable for flow chart / graphs but that's about it.",2 years ago

I use this printer for personal, school and a home business. My kids do online schooling at home, which they frequently scan and print documents.
The All-in-one printer, software, and apps are designed to save time. It is fast and hands-free with two-sided printing and scanning. The auto-feeder is easy to use, place the document(s) on top of the feeder slot, the scanner will beep once notifying the document are inserted correctly, and finally press the scan button on the touchscreen, mobile device app or the computer software. The auto-feeder can hold up to 35 pages, and can be scanned 2-sided. Wow! This is a fast scanner.
The OfficeJet Pro is very convenient when working at multiple locations. Its software, apps, and online features allow the freedom for cloud printing via Wi-Fi or cellular. Using the HP Smart app, one can quickly access and print documents/images from Dropbox and Google Drive. There is the option to save a scanned document to an HP Smart folder onto a cloud file hosting server (Dropbox, Google Drive, One Drive, Box, Evernote, and even Quickbooks). To do this is very simple, create a ""Smart Task"" on the HP Smart app, select one of the above cloud file storage service, log in, accept an agreement, name the task and click save/done. After creating a Smart Task, or many Smart Tasks, this will be a time saver because, with a few steps, one can print in a specific format/setting, send a file via email, or save to the selected cloud storage. When documents are scanned using Smart Tasks, there is an option to save it as editable and searchable. Having document files save as searchable saves me a lot of time from opening many similar docs to finding the one I need. The Smart Task is available on a computer and the mobile app.
HP printing is also possible via an email address. With a private email address for the printer, one can print by sending email messages to the printer. If desired, one can even share this email with friends and family. When there is a print from an email, it prints any attached file(s) and a final page with email context. Taking a photo with a mobile device and using the HP print email allows printing from virtually anywhere. Very convenient!
The printer has two paper trays which make refills less frequent or when using two different types of paper. On the main tray I have the regular white paper, and on tray 2 I sometimes have elegant paper. To print using paper in tray 2, select the preference in the printing setting and change the paper source to tray 2.
When it comes to the ink supply, there is two option: buy the cartridge when it runs out or subscribe to HP Instant Ink plan. When the printer is set up with a plan, and the printer anticipates that ink level is low, it automatically orders new ink cartridges.
I am satisfied with the printing, scanning, and software of the OfficeJet Pro 9025. The Smart Tasks app has saved me a lot of time by automatically saving to a cloud service. It makes it easy for me to work on any computer and have my files accessible.",2 years ago

It has a great little screen for performing just about every function you can think of directly, including maintenance, faxing, copying, emailing .pdf scans, etc. Will also tell you ink capacity, and when there are firmware updates.

Unboxing, and setup is probably at least a 30 minute task. This printer comes with tons of tape, all around different components, no doubt keeping things safe for shipping, but it will take you a while to locate all the blue tape they have in, and some of that blue tape is kind of hidden. While it does come with a very simple set of setup instructions, there were many pieces of tapes that needed to be removed that are hidden, and not mentioned in the very brief included printed setup guide.

Setup onto my wi-fi network was very easy via the touchscreen. It just scans available wi-fi routers, choose yours, and use the touchpad to enter in your home network wi-fi password.

There is also an ethernet port, if you prefer to connect locally to your ethernet home network, and also a USB port if you want to connect directly to a computer.

You can also download and install the Epson iPrint app, if you want to print or scan from your Android or iOS device. Your mobile device needs to be on your home wi-fi network in order to see the printer, and from there you can go about printing documents on your device, or scanning. I have been using this app to scan multi-page documents, via the printer’s top feeding multi-page feeder, called the ADF, autodocument feeder, and it works great. No paper jams so far, and is far faster than using the “flatbed” on the printer if you have to scan loads of pages in. Quality at both 150dpi, and 300dpi is great. Nice color scans!

Print quality seems to be great for my work from home use, as is the 2 sided printing, which is awesome, and the first “home” printer I have ever had that did this.

If there is any one thing that I can say, and this is a big one, is that you cannot use third-pary ink on this printer. The Epson firmware, and the design of their actual ink-tanks, have a chip on it, preventing the use of any third-party ink. The epson ink is very expensive, and the only ink that will work, costs about a third of the actual printer price! If you are a heavy printer, this is something to keep in mind. I repeat, you cannot use third party ink. The firmware and chip on board the ink cartridges will prevent you from using nothing but their own ink.",1 year ago
614,615,6426722,PhillipB,4,Great WFH printer.,"This WFH Covid-19 has really pushed for the use of technology.

This item really helps families like mine stay on track.

Setup was a snap.
Network connection was easy and straightforward. I did it via wireless. I followed the step by step guide and used the Android app as well. Registered on line and was done. Setup for cloud based scanning was easy as well.

Printing speed and quality is great.

Scanning was easy to use usb, cloud, email, network.

Touch screen is nice was sensitive enough and easy to use.

So going back to my family/kids. Having to get them to hold up their work to take photos with their chromebook is near impossible to get a clear image which resulted in frustrated kids, parents, and teachers. This resulted in kid melt downs due to stress. You get the point. Anyway this scan feature resolved that and the ADF for scanning and copying is great.

Only con is that twice it disconnected from my wireless network which required me to unplug and plug back in.

Only concern I have is the ink cartridges. They do not seem to be high capacity and may run out if you do high volume.

Other than that I would recommend this product especially with the WFH Covid-19..

615,616,6426722,MigDigital,5,Compact and Practical Printer for small work,"This is review of Epson WF-3820 after user being able to install ink cartridge and initialize successfully the printer for first time.
(If upon starting for first time and ink cartridge place holder doesn’t move such to insert them, then that is entirely different experience and review)
The printer is a compact and multifunctional for small office work that require Fax, Scanning, Copy, and Print.
Setting up each of connection type that is quite straight forward for default configuration to start immediately. However worth to notice different variation of configuration for each type of activity is allowed. 
For instance, it work seamless with Epson Connected web services, which allow to setup to sent to specific Epson printer email address via which user can print or scan and secure by users allowed for the activity. Have setup such without need of being physically next to the printer can Scan or Print and works nicely.
Allow to setup printing in variety of modes to save ink like print with controls for each activity in Scan and Print. I have’t measured how much can be saved, and it might not be perfect but having such option at least help to last a bit longer the ink.
Then I think as most printer does today, it allow to setup to copy and save in network as would be in larger size of printer at big organization, with integration to Dropbox, Google Drive or personal network with some level of security control.
Another observation is the speed of print and scanning is noticeably fast compared to past version of WF in the context of printing and scanning simple page. 
In the specification of printer doesn’t mention is Scan resolution is max 600 DPI.

Now, while trying to scan from iPad using app EpsonSartPanel, it doesn’t recognize automatically if paper is placed on Glass or ADF Feeder. Manually need to select the source. 
Then where it comes bit short is Epson offers number of applications need to install to fully take advantage of the printer features like text recognition need an application, for maintenance and monitoring different one, network event monitor, and they are not all same across device platforms in same way. For instance from iConnect installed in iPad, cannot check for firmware update. As result found bit lost at the end but this has been the case from past and not unique to the printer under review.

Then for some might find negative that for the printer cannot replace with third party ink cartridges at least as of date of review. 

In short, the printer offers what mostly used for larger organizations with packed features and ease of setting up for basic need but limited to small printing and scanning. Then it is flexible to use from multiple device platform compatible for remote task at enterprise level.",1 year ago
616,617,6426722,TechGuru,4,"Easy to use, all-in-one wireless printer","This All-in-one inkjet printer is a great home or small office printer that offers wireless printing, copy, scan and fax. 
What is in the box: WorkForce Pro WF-3820 printer; Power cord, 1 black, 1 Cyan, 1 Magenta, 1 Yellow Ink Cartridges, Setup manuals, CD
Unbox & Setup: This printer is well packaged in the box and packaged in the plastic bag with handles for easy lifting from the box. Nice thoughtful packing. After unpacking from the bag, this printer is packed with enormous packing tape for transporting. Its little overkill of packing tape and took few additional minutes to remove the tape.
Setup is very easy. Switch on and the easy to use 2.7 inch color touchscreen guides you to setup the printer. It does provide quick navigation and control and the touch screen is so intuitive and responsive. You can also connect by downloading the Epson smart panel app to your IOS or android device by downloading from the Appstore. Once downloaded, its very easy to setup wireless connectivity for the printer. If you are using the laptop, just go to Epson website and search for 3820 printer and support site for driver and quick connect software for easy setup. Once connected, just insert the ink cartridges and setup is done. 
It does print fast with its precision core heat free technology and handles good volume of printing. It has a capacity of 250 sheet paper capacity and does auto 2 sided printing which is a must for all printers. With working from home and kids still doing home schooling due pandemic it’s a must for 2 sided printing for paper efficiency and wastage. We do have 2 laser printers but was lacking the 2 sided auto printing and was wasting lot of papers. Printing is fast and quality is excellent. 
If also copies well and the scanning is so seamless. With Epson scansmart its very easy to scan and edit. 
Overall, it’s a great all in one smart printer that is very easy to setup, fast scanning, duplex, wireless and highly recommend for anyone who needs to print vibrant color copies and is good for basic printing. Only caveat is this printer is designed to use only Epson cartridges and not third party ink cartridges and that would set expensive ink replacements.",1 year ago
617,618,6426722,APFLORES413,5,Very great quality printing,"I’m always in need of printers in my household. Having both kids at home doing online learning, many of their text books or readings are not available in hard copy. So I need to print them out. And it’s not just them, but for my own home office needs, I need a reliable and fast printing printer that allows all of us to print within the safety of our own home. Thank goodness for this WorkForce Pro that meets all of our daily needs. My computer crashed a week ago and we ended up moving to strictly mobile devices (iPads and Android Tablets), and we needed a printer that was easy to setup for these devices. After a couple of weeks I am very well pleased with this Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3820.

Pros:
-Setup. All too easy. Simply plug it in and power it up. You are met with the Home Screen and can add your printer onto your home WiFi network. It quickly identified my wifi, and I was up within minutes. My Tab S7 is my primary device and it was a dream to set up and start printing. My kids’ devices (non-Android) was equally easy to set up, they didn’t even need me to help them. Once it was up and running on the home wi-fi, all of our devices quickly began utilizing this printer. 
-Printing quality: it is amazingly clear and crisp quality. You don’t get the cheap ink feeling/look after it prints, you know? Where it looks like it bleeds through. This doesn’t, an almost laser-like quality. That speaks volume for this ink printer. I printed up my 15 page report double sided at 3:33 seconds. It would’ve been faster but the first page took almost a minute. But after that it fed and printer both sides rather quickly. 
-Scanning: same as the printing quality, you feed your documents letters up in the top feeder. It again met my needs and quickly printed up in mixed color and b&w documents with almost same original quality. Before, I thought the heavier weight of paper the better quality. That is still a good principle, but I was using standard 20 lb white paper and the copy quality was amazing! I can’t wait to use 24 lb paper next. 
-Touchscreen: this is by far the best feature on this printer. There is no lag or freezes on this interface. It’s as if you are using a tablet screen (a good tablet). Simply sliding your fingers left or right will ring the next touch icon. Very responsive, unlike other printers out there. 

Cons:
-ate my page. Unfortunately when copying through the top feeder, it did jam and ate one of my original documents at the top of the page. Simply removing the left door hatch above the feeder to remove the jammed paper, slide it in and copied it without anymore issues. 
-Size: the WF-3820 is a big machine. It easily takes up a lot of space on the desktop. 

Overall, very pleased with this printer. Makes all of our office needs simple and painless. For better quality prints, I do recommend using 24 lb paper, but the standard 20 lb you buy at the stores will pass.",1 year ago

621,622,6426722,WF3820,5,"Has ADF, scans legal-sized docs, has 4 cartridges","My nephew took it out of the box and removed tape and put in the inks.  When I arrived I needed to do the setup with my computer and print out an important paper, sign it, and scan it in and then email it back.  It worked and I am a senior citizen.  I just tried scanning a legal-sized paper by feeding it in the feeder.  Remember that the platten is only the standard 8 1/2 x 11.  It did scan the whole legal-sized paper.  Note that if you have to print on both sides, the printer stops and you have to turn the paper over to get the second side to print.  The printer software does tell you this.  I still need to practice on this so that I don't print the second side of the paper on top of the first side! 

It seems sturdy and able to do what I want.  Also, it has a black cartridge and separate cartridges for cyan, yellow, and magenta.  I like this since some printers stop working if even one color runs out and forces you to replace the whole color cartridge, but, again, this has separate cartridges, which is a plus.  Other reviews say that the cartridges will be expensive to replace and the printer is fixed so that it does not work with other brands of inks that are cheaper.  

I read a lot of reviews and this printer seemed to be the best for my needs and the best priced relative to wanting a printer that could scan legal-sheets on both sides, that was a flatbed printer, and that had at least 4 printer cartridges.  If it could print automatically on both sides it would be even better; however, most of the printers I looked at cost a lot more or did not have one of the features I mentioned.  Having the Feeder was a plus so that this printer could copy a legal-sized paper although the platten is not legal-sized.  Other printers that I have had are much larger and more expensive.  Also, it has fax capabilities.   I would recommend this.",10 months ago

625,626,6426722,Zerofx1,4,Fast and responsive home printer,"I have had this printer for a few weeks now.  I bought this one to replace a 440 that was giving me problems printing clearly.  This printer is fairly large and maybe overkill for just basic home use.  It has a larger footprint than the 440 it replaces but that is to be expected as it is in a different class and could be used for small businesses.  I could have gone with something in the league of the 440, however I wanted a printer that a tray to conceal the paper and keep it from getting dust and debris into the tract.  That was part of the problem of the 440 I had with it's exposed feeder.  If paper sat for too long it would have an effect on the head.  This printer though solves that problem.

Another issue I had with my 440, was responsiveness of the touch keys.  It also felt cheap to the touch and often button presses would require two or more inputs to get things right.  Connecting to a wireless network was a pain in this regard if you ever shut it off or had a power outage and needed to reconnect.  The 3820 has no such problems.  the touchscreen, though almost comically small for this day and age is super responsive.  There is also a decent amount of haptic feedback to convey selections or inputs.  

This printer was also super easy to install to any workstation running on a newer OS.  I have one Win8 machine that was plagued with issues concerning drivers.  Not sure this is the fault of Epson though.  I would lean more toward this being a Win8 issue.  Connecting to the printer via the wireless is your best bet and super easy to do with laptops, phones and tablets.  

I am still using the standard ink cartridges that came with this unit and have about 60% of the ink left.  I might upgrade to the XL ink cartridges to get more live out of them.

As far printing goes, this thing is much better than my old 440.  There is a night and day difference with color photos when comparing the 3820 to my old printer.  Colors are more crisp and show no fading.  The 440 also seemed like it would saturate the page with ink with photo type print jobs.  The 3820 doesn't do this.  

Scanning is easy and scan to print jobs are clear and illustrate exactly what was scanned.  I haven't used the scan function, so I can not say anything about it or how well it might or might not work.

To wrap up, the 3820 is a fast and easy to use printer that could serve you well for personal use, school use, and perhaps small business.  I used this at times for work related print jobs and did things well.  I think I would burn through the ink if I worked from home everyday.  

If not for a disconnect issues where the wireless connection failed where i had to reboot the unit twice, and if not for the ink being consumed fairly quickly despite what I would call regular to infrequent use, I would have given this product 5 stars.  It is important to note that after a recent firmware update, I have not had the wireless disconnect and rebooting issue return.  I would recommend this printer to anyone.",1 year ago
626,627,6426722,JerryZ,5,"Scan and printer, all in one great machine.","Printing with four (4) individual color cartridges (one is black) gives me good control regarding supply costs. I always like to have a fresh supply, especially when the printer is new. I print a lot of proof drawings and other work documents a home. Having the wireless option means anyone on my network can print to the Epson WF-3820. 

Sure it can still use a network cable or the USB port, but for printing today, wireless is the way to go. I've had great luck with Epson remote printing. This way I can print while away from home and my printouts are waiting for me when I get home. Scanning with the 35-page document feeder is a must for me. With my OCR and file apps, I scan and file invoices, receipts and documents for later retrieval and long term storage.

Features I like:
* The ink cartridges are easy to install and monitored by software. 
* easy to clear jams with rear removable paper path. 
* Paper tray hold up to 14"" x 8-1/2"" sheets.
* Ink prices comparable to other office printers.
* two (2) sided printing from the print page screen 
* fairly quiet printing
* prints right from my cellphone",5 months ago

AirPrint/WiFi is printing easy between iPhones and iPad. Clear control panel. Scanner works well, the document feeder is a great feature and works.

To confirm it I installed the printer on a second computer on the same network and it seems to be working well. The installer works well and I didn't have any problem finding the printer on our home network. There are a lot of optional settings which can be somewhat confusing (if you choose to change them).

It prints up to 38 monochrome pages per minute, and it is not loud. It is straightforward to set up on my home office network, its kid of a plug and play device. Once on the network, I connected the printer to my Google Cloud Print account, and this allows me to print basically from any place in the world where there is an internet connection. Cloud printer, when set up correctly, is handy and allows a business to run more smoothly. The box comes included with a starter toner that will yield 1500 pages prints. Replacing toner is relative easy. Double side printer is done manually, but it is quick and easy; it requires the user to place the printed document on the multipurpose tray #1. Text is printed with sharp clarity, providing results that I can rely on for my home business. Now my printings run more smoothly because this printer requires very little intervention- tray #2 holds up to 250 sheets and the multipurpose tray #1 holds up to 100 sheets. I use the multipurpose tray for specialized sheets or reprinted forms. When needed, tray #1 & #2 can accept legal-size documents. The device does not print on envelopes, but to get around this, I use rectangular shipping labels. 
Overall, this is an outstanding small monochrome laser printer with professional print quality. It is very convenient and excellent for any office.

634,635,6348964,SteveC,5,Very good SOHO printer,"We have two older Brother laser printers and one of them was starting to sound funny when printing so I decided it was time to try something else. One of my first laser printers was an old HP laser that a friend gave me, that was back in 1995 and it lasted for many years, so I was always a fan of the HP laser printers, just not the pricing as the Brothers were always cheaper and cheaper to maintain until now.

Unboxing:
The printer comes with everything you need to get set up and printing right away. There’s the printer “naturally”, power cord, USB cable, Ethernet patch cord, an already installed beginner cartridge that’s rated at 1500 pages, and all the paperwork.

Setting up:
Setting it up was very simple, I didn’t even have to attach it to my computers USB port first. I just plugged it into our network switch and the HP software I already had for our HP color inkjet found it and asked if I wanted to set it up, pretty simple.

There are two paper trays though, and the one under the front cover is called tray #1, the tray at the bottom of the printer is tray #2, it’s sort of confusing but it works. We filled tray #2 with paper, “it holds 250 sheets”, leaving tray one hidden “it will be used for envelopes and anything we need to feed manually.

I did go to the HP website and downloaded a full set up drivers and software as the HP Windows 10 app seemed a little too limited. It will ask you how the printer is hooked up, “either directly to your computer or on a network”, I selected “network” and it found it within a couple seconds. This wasn’t a difficult set up at all.

Printing and Quality:
Now this printer is fast, really fast once it gets going. The warm up time is very short, just a few seconds and it’s off and running. I do like that there’s a two line display showing status and any errors, with our Brother printers you only get lights and have to reference a guide on top to figure out what they mean.

Print quality is superb; it looks sharper than either of our Brother printers. Text is super crisp and the fonts / graphics edges are nice and sharp, another great HP printer.

Impressions:
This model doesn’t support Wi-Fi or have full automatic duplex printing, not an issue for us as it’s hooked to our network and any two sided printing we may do “very rare in our case” can be done manually.

The printer itself doesn’t make any more noise over our Brother printers, very close noise level, but it does print faster, and the sharpness of the print job is enough to where you can see it upon close comparison. 

The included “starter” cartridge does give you 1500 sheets, and a replacement cartridge is rated at 3k, there are high capacity cartridges rated at 7k sheets available if you happen to do a lot of printing.

The brother cartridges were rated at around 1200 sheets but cost half as much, as a normal 3k rated one so in the end the HP is actually cheaper to print with it just costs more initially when you purchase the cartridge.

If you are in the market for a SOHO printer than can handle a lot of printing then I’d definitely look at this one, it can print all day long and not hiccup.",2 years ago
635,636,6348964,DavidJr,5,"Quick, sharp, black/grayscale prints","This is a simple ethernet or USB connected monochrome laserjet printer. Super fast printing which claims up to 40ppm. It is a matter of seconds from the time the computer spools it to the time in hand. Multiple page documents completed before most inkjet printers even get the first page out. However, it is single sided only with manual double sided requiring the user to place the documents back in tray 1. 

Setup can be simple or complex, depending on how you want to manage the printer. If it is self managed it will use DHCP IP and basic default settings. If it is IT Managed you can get down to the fine details of how you want to use this printer and ensure it meets your security demands. All of the settings can be changed later through its IP web page. The web interface allows for most of the advanced configuration. This includes access lists, firewall rules, security certificates, syslog connection and enabling/disabling certain web features such as AirPrint and Google Cloud Print. It also provides usage details, ink levels and tools in case of print quality issues. 

Once it was identified on my network I used the default Windows 10 drivers and the HP Smart app and have experienced a fair bit of delay in getting documents to spool to the printer. However, on a different computer I used the HP m404-m405 installation software first and had no delay. I ended up going back and removing the installed drivers under printer server properties and doing the HP install again and all works perfectly. The installation software requires diagnostic information to be collected, but that can later be disabled in the printer assistant software. During setup it also mentions that Wi-Fi Direct is enabled, even though the M404n does not include wireless. 

Besides printing quickly, the black levels are sharp and detailed. Even sending full colored photos to it to print came out in a wide range or gray scale detail. If you are looking for a small quick black only quality printer, that you can customize to meet your security demands, then this is certainly a worthwhile contender.",2 years ago
636,637,6348964,KansasMeddlingMom,4,So Far So Good,"Honestly, when I ordered the HP - LaserJet Pro M404n Black-and-White Printer, I did not realize that in order to print wirelessly, this machine would require the user to connect this printer to their router with an Ethernet cord, which by the way is not included with the printer. The box contained the printer with the 58 A introductory print cartridge, the power cord, and some setup and explanatory paperwork. 

So either you use the Ethernet cord, on you to procure, and then you will have wireless printing, or you can also connect the printer to the computer by USB. It is very important to download the HP Smart app; I got it from the Google Play Store since I use an android smartphone, a Samsung. This app was vital to the setup of the printer, and you can see that I have included screenshots of some of the pages within it. I tried to download the software to my computer through HP's website to no avail, but when I went back and read the original product request, it explicitly stated to download the app, (PLEASE NOTE: To review this item you must be willing and able to download the HP Smart App to your smart phone),.which made installation and connection a no brainer. The smartphone, through the app, finds your HP printers, those already installed and operational and this new one that needed to become operational and takes you through a series of steps to get it going-easy peasy. 

As you can see from my attached photos, the footprint of this printer is small and the serviceable-area required to just place it on a good size desktop is very manageable. The speed to get the 1st page out is quick and all the subsequent pages. Print quality is excellent, but I have had issues with other HP printers and it is my bum luck that my issues seem to occur outside of the 1 year warranty. Be vigilant with any odd situations or issues that may make you guess whether or not there really is a warranty issue. I would err on the side of caution and call the HP group to establish any potential issues. I have noted that both Brother and Epson have extended the traditional 1 year term.",2 years ago
637,638,6348964,Panther68,5,VERY Fast Printer...but VERY Slow Warm-Up,"Laser printers have several advantages over inkjet printers…but, at the same time, there are certain advantages that ink jet printers have over laser printers. The HP LaserJet Pro M404n is a perfect example. Is the M404n right for you? We shall see……….

UNBOXING & INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:
Many companies have switched to “environmentally-friendly packaging” (cardboard, as opposed to Styrofoam), including HP in many of their lower-end printers. Unfortunately, HP still uses (a lot of) Styrofoam in packaging their higher-end printers. While it does keep the printer ‘safe’ during shipping, the impact to the environment will last for several human generations. As for cables, the ONLY cable included is the power cord…there are no USB and/or Ethernet cables included. On the ‘bright’ side, the printer’s toner cartridge comes pre-installed.

SETUP:
This was both simple, and difficult. The physical setup, as well as installing the drivers & software, were a breeze. Setup consisted of plugging in the power cable, connecting the Ethernet cable (the printer can be connected directly to a single computer, via USB, if you don’t want/need network printing capabilities), powering the printer up, and answering a few simple questions on the printer’s 2-line LCD display. For driver/software installation, you have two options – you can download the HPEasyStart file (6.43MB), or you can download the full-install package (111.5MB). The first option is the easier, and smarter, way to go, as it will only download the components needed for your specific setup, and will walk you through every (well, almost every, as I later discovered, and will explain, below) step of the install/configure process.

As mentioned, there is a slight problem in configuring everything, that being that, while configuring the EWS (Embedded Web Server settings, the ‘Internet connection’ is not automatically connected. After installation is complete, if you go to the “Web Services” tab, on the ‘Summary’ page, under ‘Internet connection’, it will indicate “Not Connected”…even though ‘Web Services Status’ shows “Enabled”, and ‘Printer connection to HP Connected’ indicates “Connected”. As discovered during a phone call with HP’s tech support, the printer’s Network connection needs to be set to a static IP, as opposed to the dynamic IP setting configured during the setup. You do this in a 2-step process. First, on the “Network” tab, under ‘General’, click on ‘Network Protocols’, and change it to “Enable IPv4 only”, then click <Apply>. Next, go to ‘Wired’ (“Network” tab), then ‘IPv4 Configuration’, and change the IP Address Configuration from “DHCP” to “Manual IP”. If everything is working as it should, your previously auto-assigned IPv4 information should automatically be filled into the ‘Manual IP’ & ‘DNS’ boxes. To finish, just click <Apply>. If you go back to the “Web Services” tab, under ‘Summary’, the Internet connection line should now read “Connected”. Needless to say, a relatively minor problem, but a bit of a PitA in regards to getting the info needed to fix it (the HP tech support person didn’t provide the solution…it was jointly discovered during the phone call.

PRINT QUALITY AND SPEED:
This is one area that laser printers greatly excel over inkjet printers. Print quality IS OUTSTANDING…the blacks are “black”, grayscale is “grayscale”, text & images are sharp…no more, and no less, than what I would have expected. HP claims a maximum print speed of 40ppm, and it’s quite accurate…and not accurate. Using a 42-page document, I ran three tests, although the first two tests produced almost-identical results. First, I printed one page, from the printer in “Sleep Mode”, then one page with printer ‘awake’, and finally the remaining 40 pages, also with the printer ‘awake’. Whether the printer was ‘asleep’, or ‘awake’, it made no difference, which I’ll explain.

With an inkjet, printing is, essentially, a 1-step process – you click <Print>, the computer sends the print data to the printer, and it prints whatever was sent. With laser printers, on the other hand, it is a 2-step process. Step 1 consists of clicking <Print>, which sends a command to the printer that a print job is about to start, the laser printer “warms up”, and finally the printer sends back a command that it’s “ready to receive the print data”. The second step consists of said print data being sent to the printer, and the printer printing what it received. In ALL three tests, the first step took approx 1.5 minutes (+/- 4 seconds). In the first two tests, the printer completed the second step in approx 10 seconds. As such, while the “printing” took only 10 seconds, the total printing process took approx 1 minute, 40 seconds. Moving onto the final test, the second step took 62 seconds. So, in essence, this does prove that HP’s claim of “printing” up to 40ppm is accurate…however, when combining the time of both steps, the total printing process took just under 2.5 minutes. While the “total printing process” might be much longer than HP’s 40ppm claim, that’s still faster than most inkjet printers. Considering that the printing was done at the ‘Normal’ setting, an equivalent print job on an inkjet might have taken considerably longer (even if printing “black only”).

ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:
HP lists the LaserJet Pro M404n as having two paper trays…and, in a matter of speaking, it does…but, not entirely. What is labeled as ‘Tray 2’ is actually your primary tray, located at the bottom of the printer, and capable of holding up to 250 sheets. Before I cover ‘tray 1’, I will mention that you can purchase/install an additional paper tray (which becomes ‘tray 3’), and has a 500-sheet capacity. Getting back to ‘tray 1’, this is accessed by opening the front panel, and manually loading (up to 150 sheets) the paper (a flip-up extender allows it to accommodate legal-length paper), or envelopes. While you could, technically, leave ‘tray 1’ loaded all the time, its real use is in temporary usage. If you want two different paper-types loaded on a regular basis, I would highly suggest/recommend purchasing the 500-sheet ‘tray 3’. Also, the 2-line display could be better. At minimum, a 3-line display should have been included. Better yet, a color touch-screen display, as seen in almost off of HP’s other LaserJet printers (including less-expensive models, wouldn’t have been too much to ask for. Looking at all their LaserJet printers in the same general price-range ($200-399), there are 9 different ‘series’, 5 of which have touch-screen displays, including two models that are up to $100 cheaper than the M404n.

THE GOOD:
• Excellent print quality
• Extremely high-speed printing
• Easy to understand/use software
• (Mostly) Simple to set up
• Compact size (for a business-oriented laser printer)

THE BAD:
• Getting the printer “internet connected” isn’t automatically accomplished, requires manual settings
• No auto-duplex printing

THE UGLY:
• For the price, HP could have easily included a touch-screen display

FINAL VERDICT:
If you’re only printing a few pages at a time, then an inkjet printer is probably your best bet. If you need to print in color, I stand by that same comment. Lastly, if your monthly printing is fairly low (say, less than 50 pages/month), then you should ask yourself if you REALLY need a laser printer. However, if you have any need for printing high-volume print jobs and/or you print over 100pages/month and/or you need printouts to be waterproof (inkjet prints are NOT waterproof, and WILL bleed if gotten wet), then a laser printer will fit your needs. The are less expensive laser printers (from HP, as well as from other manufacturers), but they will have less features/functions, slower print speeds, and (typically) only a single tray). There are also laser printers with lots more features/functions (including fax capability), faster print speeds (up to 60ppm w/ HP), and multiple trays (up to 5 w/ HP), but they can cost into the thousands of dollars. If you’re looking for a reasonably-priced black-only laser printer, with a reasonable number of features/functions, that also prints fast, HP’s M404-series of LaserJet printers will fit the bill. There are five models to choose from, with the M404n being the middle-of-the-pack.

638,639,6348964,jailoliv,4,Perfect Black and White Prints,"PROS
Fast at 40ppm 
Easy web page configuration after initial setup 
 

CONS 
No duplex capability 
Slow warm-up 

 

Setup was not complicated but it was a little bit tricky at first but after I went through the required manual steps, it became very easy. It can be connected via USB but it does not come with the cable. Not a problem for me since I prefer connecting directly to the network and because I must have a few of them hanging around anyway. 

 

If you print mostly black and white, this LaserJet Pro M404n will save you time and money, especially if you print a lot. I say that because if you print just a few pages here and there, you may actually find this printer to be slow. The reason is that laser printers usually will not start until they are warmed up and this one is no different. Printing just one page only, for instance, will take you almost 2 minutes with this printer. But once it is warmed up, it will print up to 40 pages per minute. My average was around 36 pages as it depends on what you are printing and other factors but that is still a lot of pages in single minute. 

 

Print quality was superb and although inkjet printers nowadays do a great job, they still do not compare when it comes to black and white on a good laser printer like this one. Although it does not print colors, photos were very detailed with perfect shades of gray. Again, you would not get this quality in black and white with an inkjet printer. 

 

Because I print a lot on both sides of the paper, I missed the duplex feature. That probably was my only disappointment but if you do not need that feature or are patient enough to flip the paper for the second page, you will be satisfied with it. It comes with a 350-sheet input capacity but can be upgraded to 550 sheets. 

 

Although laser printers are used mostly in offices, I would recommend the M404n at home too. The cost per page plus the quality are worth it. The cost of toner may seem high at first but they can print thousands of pages and they won’t go bad as ink would. For professional results in black and white, look no further.",2 years ago

643,644,6348964,MrAnubisKitty,5,Great printer for the office or home office,"This HP printer is great for home or office use, since it prints a lot of pages quickly, in crisp, clear print quality. It would also work well for students, for the same reason. Very reliable. Not meant to be a photo printer. It does allow to choose between document and photo when you print, so you could try photo paper and print a black and white picture, but it's really not for that purpose. It can only print 2 sided if you manually flip the paper and print on the back. 

It's primarily designed for business use, and it exceeds expectations. This printer is compatible with multiple devices and operating systems, many versions of Windows, iOS, Android, etc. I quickly downloaded the HP Smart app, which prompted me to add the HP printer plugin. It searched for and found the printer already connected to the network. Then I was able to print right from my phone- printing from downloaded files, pictures, and from email. All of these showed great print quality. And it prints so quickly, there's no hesitation. The specs say 40 pages per minute, and this seems to support that claim. It was very easy to connect to the printer, and the options were right there in the app. Whether on the computer or mobile device, it tells you to go to the website. This prompts downloading of the app on your mobile device, and software on the computer. There isn't much to set up, not complicated, allowing me to get right to printing. For me, I need something that I can print from my desk, but also from my phone, if I worked from home or have notes from a meeting to print out.

It has two trays for paper, one holds 100 pages, the other 250, and can handle different kinds of paper, and smaller sizes, but can print letter and legal size documents. I set it up so I can leave 1 kind of paper in the drawer, but print from regular paper by just selecting the other tray. It's versatile, and convenient, so I don't have to keep adding or changing paper. At the back of the printer is a place for the power cord, as well as ports for the ethernet cable, for connecting another device USB 2.0 cable, and for a USB flash drive. These are not included in the box. I didn't expect a flash drive, but was surprised it didn't have the cable, since these are inexpensive. It's a minor point, since it's not required to use the printer. An ethernet cable is required, as this printer cannot connect wirelessly, and most people will want that connectivity to their network. It's especially important if you're using a mobile devices to print from.

It was heavier than I expected, but sturdy and compact. This is not a portable device, but one for keeping in one spot. It doesn't take up much space on my desk, and since I don't need to connect a bunch of cords, it doesn't clutter the space. 

It's designed to only use an HP cartridge, with one of their chips in it. Other brands without the HP chip will probably not work in this printer, so it limits you to the HP cartridge. If the other cartridge does work, it might not work again the next time. This means you can't shop around for less expensive cartridges, but it does offer a higher level of security, which is the real purpose of the chip. It focuses on maintaining the security of the user's information as a trade-off, something many users might appreciate enough to overlook this limitation.

Pros: fast, reliable, print quality, high volume output, 1500 pages per cartridge, compact, easy to set up and use.
Cons (for some): limited to HP cartidges, not wireless, no color
Overall it's a great, reliable printer, which I expect to use for a long time.",2 years ago
644,645,6348964,btb2k,5,Business class laser printer!,"This printer is great in nearly every aspect. It looks nice, is modern and the smart toner seems to actually work really well. Setup is easy and of course, it offers network printing capability right out of the box to handle the workload for an office or home office. 

Quality - Print quality is what you'd expect to see from an HP LaserJet with crisp clear text and an overall good looking print. It doesn't curl the paper so you can easily bind or fold it. 

Speed - This printer is fast, with a quick warm-up from the energy saving mode.so it's ready to go quickly and it shoots out pages quickly making it perfect tor either the small office with multiple users or home office. The only feature this unit was missing that i wanted was a duplexer but I do believe there is another model that comes with that option. 

The cost of toner is a bit high but don't let that let you down as each cartridge will last several thousand pages or more depending on what you print and what settings you print on. 

The footprint of this printer is shockingly small for what it is when comparing to it's earlier predecessors. 

If you're looking for a simple, high quality work horse of a printer this machine is it. It matches up to the same HP LaserJet Pro quality that you'd see from earlier models except that this one is faster, quieter and uses new technology to make printing secure which is the last thing I'd say is important. 

If you print sensitive documents and you're concerned about security (like if you are a firm that handles customer information, PII or other information that you'd print on forms) this printer is essential in terms of protecting you and your customers from a breach. You can control this setting and as an administrator turn it off if it's not needed. These days, security goes beyond computers and HP seems like it's staying ahead of the curve by offering a printer that closes another potential vulnerability. 

I'd definitely recommend this printer for anyone that needs one to handle B/W printing with ease for light to medium business use. Even aside to that, just having one that is low cost to print on this one fits the bill perfectly.",2 years ago

It uses no ink, but instead uses thermal paper, which allows for it's super small size. The battery powered and Bluetooth capabilities make it a breeze to take with you! The battery lasts for a reasonable amount of time, but could be better. Just printing about 8 pictures over the course of a few days, it went from fully charged to around 20%. Some of that is most likely idle time, as I did not manually shut it off in-between uses. I have it set to turn itself off after an hour and sleep after Sleep after 5 minutes. Still, not too shabby for it's small size.

The HP Sprocket software that you download and use to connect to the printer is really quite well done, and very easy to use. Even if you don't have a Sprocket printer, it would make a nice image editing tool for your phone. It connectes to Instagram, Facebook, Google, and your local images on your phone or tablet. Really makes it easy to make prints of your online photos.

The size of the prints limits their use, obviously. Not something you'll be printing any detail with, but for fun-sized photos for sharing with friends, it's great. The paper has peel off backs that allow you to make stickers out of the little photos. This would make a great gift for a kid or scrapbook keeper.

The HP Sprocket app lets you crop, adjust color settings, add borders, text, little fun graphics you can add on top of the photo, and overlays. You can use these features to edit your photos, then print out on a larger printer or share to one of your social media sites.

My colleague was able to download the Sprocket software and connect to my printer. It's supposed to support up to 3 additional connections, although I only tried myself and one other.

You can change the color of the little LED on the front to whatever color you like, which is a nice little personalization feature. 

The printer takes about 45 seconds from the time you press print to print an image, so the speed isn't great if you are wanting to print several photos to distribute. 

The software has a Photo booth mode which takes 4 timed pictures and combines them into one image. This is fun for taking pictures with friends.

The printer itself is really light, but feels well made. Changing the paper is easy. Just pop off the top and insert into the tray. It comes with a pack of 10 papers, including a calibration sheet. They recommend not putting any more paper than this to avoid jams.",3 years ago
654,655,6473926,RedScorpion,4,Fun and Getting Better,"The HP Sprocket 2nd Edition uses no ink and instead heats ZINK paper to reveal the photo in a single pass. It’s fun. The pictures are cute and you can stick them to anything. 

I feel like this printer is a Polaroid for the digital age. Everyone has a phone and this printer produces instant prints for far less money than a Polaroid or an inkjet.

Multiple devices can hook up to the printer at the same time. At one point I had a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, an iPhone, and an iPad hooked up. The apps work virtually the same regardless of device and connection was simple.

But, I was expecting a bit more from a 2nd Edition. The prints look good, but they aren’t great. It won’t replace a good inkjet for overall printer quality. I noticed banding in skies or solid colors and sometimes flesh tones would get overblown or washed out.

The big new feature with the second edition is the AR. You can now print from a video clip or put an animated frame and when you scan the picture with the app, the picture will come to life and even play a video clip. The AR feature worked well on my iPhones and even displayed location information and google street information for the pictures. You can decide if you want information embedded in the print or not.

The AR prints were, again, fun. But, some AR features were limited by which device I used to view the photo. For instance, I could create a picture with an embedded video on my phone and view the video with my phone, but if I tried to view that same video on another phone, it wouldn’t work. It would still show location data and any photos related to that location, but I couldn’t watch the picture come to life with the embedded video clip. This makes sense as it is pulling the file from my original device and not a cloud service. But, I wish it was a universal feature... Now, the animated borders and stickers will work on any phone with the app. 

However, I couldn’t get the AR features to work on my tablets. My Samsung Galaxy crashed whenever I tried to view any AR details and the iPad didn’t fare much better. It just never could reveal anything. Now, I could view the embedded location information printed from my tablets on my iPhone, but the opposite didn’t work. I know all devices had the AR features turned on.

Battery life is okay, but if you are using this at a party or group function, I would have it plugged in. After 5 - 6 photos, my battery would be down to the final bar. On that note, the charging cable is too short. I think it is only a foot and a half.

It appears that HP is adding more features and functions to the app and the printer at all times. So, I am hopeful that there will be more AR borders and stickers in the future as the current selection is rather slim.

Also, I would like it if we could get a PC driver at some point. I don’t see why laptops or surface devices can’t join the party. 

So, would I recommend the Sprocket? Sure. I am having a lot of fun with it. I don’t know if the new features are enough to warrant an upgrade for original Sprocket owners, but at $5 - $10 for a pack of 20 prints, I think this is a great pick-up. I look forward to getting a travel case and a small photo booklet.",3 years ago

659,660,6473926,Kris1973,4,Incredibly fun little sticker printer.,"Starting with the positives: This little printer is incredibly easy to set up and fun to use. Within fifteen minutes of opening the box, I had printed through the 10-pack of Zink paper included with the printer, testing out everything from printing selfies to greenery and even some graphic art, which brings me to one of the most enjoyable things about the HP Zinc paper: It’s self-adhesive. Printing out little 2x3 stickers with your pictures or little sayings is a lot of fun! While quite small for a photo print at 2” by 3”, the pictures do print completely edge-to-edge so there’s no wasted space. 2x3 is small for a print, but seems oddly appropriate for a sticker. 

The built-in battery lasts through about one pack of ten prints before needing a recharge and the prints come out quickly with a satisfying little hum. It reminds me of taking Polaroid pictures back in the “old” days.

On the down side, the colors in the prints can be (but aren’t always) somewhat washed out - particularly skin tones, though at least the resolution is fine enough that the prints don’t end up looking grainy. I think the Zink paper still has a little trouble with vibrant reds, which is why I dropped my review down to 4 stars.

So, if you’re looking for a fun little battery powered portable printer that can print out 2x3 stickers for you and your friends (or kids), this is it. Because the “ink” is in the paper, the refill packs of paper can be somewhat pricey but Best Buy was running a sale on refills so I stocked up on a few packs while the price was more attractive.",3 years ago

661,662,6473926,Hinata,4,very fun and versatile,"I really wanted one, and i was eyeing on a different product. However I was lucky to get this one on sale. I'm not much of a HP user, but I do like their products that come out. Sometimes they are unresponsive however if you have patience to be able to fix the simplest things yourself, basically just restarting it, then it works fine. 

This sprocket itself is one of them. I have to sometimes restart the app in order for the pictures I just took to work (to show in the selection). I read the reviews and i can see why people say they see the red hue on the skintone. But after following the directions of the HP Support, it looks fine.

As you can see, starting from the left, I tried one in black & white, it came out a tint of blue. 2nd one I tried the wand that the HP Support recommended to do, it look animated. And the 3rd one is without and it looked fine. The other 3 I did i used the wand and thy came out amazing.

I hope they come out with more borders and stickers in the app for the sprocket, I like playing with those. I do recommend people to give it a shot, at least this product.",1 year ago
662,663,6473926,Gus321,5,Absolutely Love This!,This is exactly what I was looking for. You have so many different printing options using the accompanying app. I print pictures to add to my planner and journal. It is very simple to use.,1 year ago
663,664,6473926,Danno,4,Fun and Quick!,"If you’re on the go and looking for a fun way to print photos, then this is it. After charging the unit for about an hour it was ready to use. It can connect to your smart device via Bluetooth. Download the app and you’re able to print pocket-sized photos. Printing a photo is a quick and easy process. Open the app, select the photo you want to print and press the printer button. In a matter of 15 seconds, it’s printed.

The quality isn’t as nice as a larger printer, but it’s not shabby for something that fits in the palm of my hand.

The app also allows you to make edits and add fun little things to the photo. It was pretty cool to print a photo I had just posted to my social media.

I brought it to a friend’s house and it was a hit. Everyone loved trying it out and wanted to use it. People loved the idea of being able to snap a photo and quickly print it for a keepsake.

My wife is excited about using this because she thinks it’ll be a great resource for adding photos to the “baby book” for our child. I admit, it’ll be pretty cool.

Takeaway:
Because of the size, I wonder how many photos will print before I have to purchase ink. Also, having to purchase the photo paper is a drag, but not a deal breaker. I like the idea of being able to print things quickly from my phone.

Try not to mind the qality of the photo, it was tough trying to focus on both the phone and printed image.",1 year ago

673,674,6402214,DaveW,4,Printing On the Go,"The Canon Selphy QX10 is a compact mobile printer that produces 2.7” x 2.7” “polaroid-esque” print. It’s internal battery lets you print on the go from your mobile device using the Canon Selphy Photo Layout App (iOS and Android). I have a Polaroid camera that I like to use every so often, so the Selphy printer is a nice little alternative. It not a large device – about 2 pounds and just smaller than an old Sony Discman that we all (30+ crowd) carried around as kids.

Starting off the Selphy uses a special type of paper and ink. This isn’t like other portable printers that were the zero ink variety, but a process called dye-sub (heat transfer printing). This is a process used in full size photo printers as an alternative to inkjet, and its generally known for its reliability and quality. So back to the special paper and ink – the printer comes with a sample ink cartridge and 3 sheets of printer stock. I ordered the XS-20L paper pack, which came with an ink cartridge and 20 sheets of photo stock from Best Buy for 15 bucks. This works out to $0.75/print before you factor in the cost of the printer. Not wildly expensive, but you pay premium for getting your pics instantly. So far I have printed 13 pictures, so I have a decent idea of what I’m doing. 

Setup with the Selphy was…interesting. The printer connects via Wi-Fi direct, not Bluetooth. However, the printer doesn’t have an interface, but rather just a power button. This is where the app comes in. To pair/connect your phone to the printer you need to scan the QR code on the printer with the app. Once its connected you are good to go, or you should be. I ran into problems getting my phone to connect. I have an LG V40 running Android 10. I tried connect 7 or 8 times to no avail. I had my GF try to connect her Samsung Galaxy S9+ running Android 10, and she connected straight away. I was confused, so I started toggling settings to get my phone to connect. I found that my Wi-Fi radio has to be turned off for my phone to pick up the printer. The app notifies you that your Wi-Fi is off, and that it needs to turn it on to connect, which it then does. Weird. So if you have problems connecting to the printer then I suggest turning off your Wi-Fi. Loading the paper is easy – open the bottom compartment and load the paper with the backing facing up (a little diagram inside shows this as well). Loading the ink cartridge requires you to pop open the side hatch and slide it in until it clicks. The cartridge can only go in one way, so you can get it backwards. The manual mentions the need to tighten the ink cartridge sheet if it is loose/sagging before inserting into the printer. My 2 cartridges (the sample and the one I bought) were both fine, but to tighten reminds me of winding old cassette tapes.

Once connected you get into the photo collage app and you can select pictures to print, create layouts, add filters, borders, etc. I printed pictures that I took with my front facing camera, rear camera, and even my mirrorless camera to see if there were any differences in print quality. My mirrorless camera is a Canon EOS M6 Mark II, and I have the Canon Camera Connect app to transfer pictures directly from the camera to my phone without any compression. I was hoping there would be a way for me to connect the M6 to the Selphy directly, but to no avail. I saw a youtuber pull it off with the M6 and the Selphy CP1300, but only because the CP1300 does not rely on an app to facilitate the connection. I was a little disappointed in this missing connectivity, but its not a dealbreaker or even a knock on the product.

The way the Selphy prints is pretty interesting. It passes the paper in and out several times while making the print. It lays down a single color with each pass and follows CMYK colors. First pass is yellow, then magenta, then cyan, and the last pass is black (hard to tell on this one), and the protective overlay. In the collage app you can add overlay effects that show up with that final pass – they are somewhat hard to see so I don’t really use them. Each print takes about a minute, so you don’t have to wait too long. I did find, however, that each time I went to print I would run into connection errors again. As long as I toggled off my Wi-Fi before printing I was fine. I should mention I did all my printing while I was at home, so maybe this won’t be an issue for me if I am out and about and sitting on a mobile data connection. Either way, it bugs me and it only affects my phone and not my GF’s. 

Print quality was pretty good. Like I said I tried 3 different sources for the prints to see if the quality of the print was impacted. Honestly, I really couldn’t tell the difference. The picture that came out the best was actually taken from my front facing camera (8MP) which has the lowest resolution of the 3 (rear camera – 16MP, M6 Mark II – 32.5MP). The prints from my front camera appeared a bit sharper and brighter while the images from the other 2 sources looked softer and smoothed out – making them look a bit dull. This may be due to operator error, but I made 13 prints and the results were consistent depending on the source. The 2 front facing pics I had were the least smoothed, so they looked crisp. The higher res sources just had a lot more processing/compression done to them to print – I guess.

Using the printer was pretty easy and it worked pretty well. However, the app still needs work. It’s not super well laid out, the settings were lacking, and the photo browser was slow to show thumbnails. My main critique is picture positioning – there is none. The app doesn’t let you move the focus around on the pic so if you want to re-center or crop something out – no luck. You need to do all of those edits prior to getting into the app. The other thing about the app I didn’t like was it never showed the picture at a good resolution. I selected a high res pic, and the app showed it looking very compressed and fuzzy. Made me think my pic was messed up or that’s how it would print – either way it threw me off and made me unsure if my print would turn out OK. I think you are better off making all edits and adding text or whatever in other apps, saving the pic, and then going into the Selphy app to print.

Overall am I happy with the printer? Yeah I’d say so. It’s a niche little item that I think would be fun to have around at parties (in a post COVID world that is), outings, etc. Its not going to replace a full size photo printer or ordering prints. My GF likes to do a pin up photo collage that she regularly updates, so she really likes it. If you are into Polaroid shots already, then this is right up your alley. It delivers that same feel, but with a much higher quality. The paper is a little hard to come by (Best Buy is currently sold out), but once the printer has been out longer the paper should become more readily available. The app certainly needs work, and I'd be surprised if I was the only one with the connectivity issues.",1 year ago
674,675,6402214,nickcal,3,Produces nice prints; Lacks good app support,"I come from a time when photos were captured on film and you had no idea what your image was going to look like until you get the film developed, which sometimes took 7 days for processing. I remember in my college days (20 years ago now) when we were still making scrapbooks with printed photographs. When smartphones became commonplace, we started seeing photos transition to the digital realm instead of the paper-based one. So what happens when you want to print your memories out to share? Do you go to a drugstore every time? What if you could just print the photos out at home? That’s what the Canon Selphy Square QX10 Wireless Photo Printer can do for you.

The printer comes in a Canon-branded box and is well-identified for the consumer. The unit comes with a multilingual user manual, Micro USB charging cable, a starter pack of photo paper, and the starter ink cartridge. Before I even set-up the printer, I found things I would upgrade immediately — the charging cable and the starting kit. The charging cable is Micro USB, which in my mind is ‘old technology’. It doesn’t seem very forward-thinking of Canon to release a new product with this older type of charging cable. Is it more cost-effective? Probably - but it’s not future-proof. The other issue I have is that the manual calls out using a wall adapter to charge the printer, but they don’t include one. 

The other issue I had out of the box was the miniature starter set of paper and ink. The starter ink cartridge is only enough ink to cover the 3 sheets of paper included in the starter kit. According to the specs of the device, the printer can hold up to 10 sheets of paper. I think the sample kit should include at least that much and the ink cartridge should match that. It seems silly to me for the consumer to have to purchase those items right off the bat in order to get the most out of their device. Imagine if this was received as a gift and the giver didn’t realize that what was included was such a small sample? They would effectively be telling the recipient that they had to spend money to enjoy their gift. It looks like Canon sells the set for around $15 so I’m not sure why they wouldn’t just include one set with the printer when it ships.

The user manual booklet that comes in the box with the printer provides you with details on the device and then directs you to download the mobile app to complete the set-up. As it turns out, you can only print images directly from your Android or iOS smartphone (or tablets). The printer is not compatible with desktop computers. The first device I attempted to connect to the printer (via the app) was my iPhone 11 Pro. The instructions in the app tell you to scan a QR code that’s found inside the printer cartridge compartment. The QR code is supposed to connect you to the printer’s internal Wi-Fi network. I am assuming the code contains the Wi-Fi name and password for the device’s network. I tried a couple of dozen of times to get this process to work and my iPhone would never connect. I tried to scan directly from the QR code on the plastic door of the compartment; I tried to scan the QR code from an enlarged photo I took; I tried to enter the information manually; I even tried deleting the app and reinstalling it AND resetting the printer, but I could never get the iPhone to connect to it. I kept getting a failure to connect message. Just as I was about to throw in the towel, I decided to pick up my iPad and give it a try. I downloaded the app onto the iPad and scanned the QR code and within a few seconds, the printer connected to the iPad. I still can’t figure out why there was a problem with the iPhone/printer connection, but I was at least able to use the printer.

Once the printer was connected, registered, and set-up, I selected a few photos of our family dog to print. The design interface of the Canon SELPHY app is pretty basic. You select your photo, choose a border size, the position of your photo, whether or not you want a date printed on the photo, choose a frame, add stamps or text, paint on the photo, select filters or embellishments, and then you print. 

Photos take approximately 45 seconds to print. The SELPHY Square uses a process called dye sublimation. With this process, the ink ribbon is heated and transfers the dye to a special photo paper. This process gives printed photos a much longer life (up to 100 years in some cases) than Zink-based prints. Once you send a photo from the app to print on the paper, the paper actually makes four passes through the printer ribbon. On each pass, the printer lays down a color. It goes in this order - yellow, magenta, and cyan. The fourth pass is actually a clear coat that helps to highlight the photo and protects the image.

The quality of the photos is actually very good. So, even though it seems as though I have had a lot to complain about in this review, I can’t deny that the product the printer creates is very nice. One thing I wish the software would do a bit better is to allow for some color/brightness adjustments. On the screen, I thought the photos looked fine, but when they printed out, they were a bit darker than I expected. 

As far as cost goes, photo paper and printer ribbon kit is around $15 for 20 sheets. That would mean that each print (not including this the device charge) costs approximately $0.75. To me, this is a tad on the expensive side of things since you can order larger photo prints from drugstores for about half the cost (4x4 print on standard photo paper is $0.39 per print). 

The Canon SELPHY Square is a unique mobile printer, but I think the software really needs some upgrades to make it an exceptional product. I also think the support for it should be beefed up, too since I had a lot of trouble finding answers for issues I had when I was setting it up. I hope that Canon refines this product and its offerings so that the next version is better than the first.",1 year ago
675,676,6402214,PeboQuattro,4,Hip to be square,"Recently, I have been taking photos with my Polaroid of my daughter to put in her baby book but I found myself wanting better quality photos. The Canon SELPHY Square printer is perfect for this. The SELPHY Square is a portable dye sublimation printer that delivers fast vintage style square prints that are cheaper and offer better clarity than similar Polaroid photos. My wife appreciates how the photo paper even has a removable backing so that it can stick directly to paper. The printer is battery operated so it is very portable and the app provides printing direct from your phone. The app does feel a little dated and clunky but it is manageable. Unfortunately the printer has an ad-hoc wifi that you must join every time you print, but the app automates this...mostly. I would have liked to have seen it support AirPrint for iOS devices but it isn’t a deal breaker. I could nitpick how it only came with enough ink and paper to print 5 photos (sold separately as a set) or how you can’t eliminate the borders but it works well despite the missing features. The SELPHY provides the square look with better quality prints in a convenient, portable design.",1 year ago
676,677,6402214,Caladbolg,4,A bit high on the price but great at what it does.,"This is really an incredible product. The entry price is high. And the cost per photo is a bit high too. But it produces great photos for a journal, for putting something on the fridge, to decorate your cube at work or your dorm at school.

I can't help but think that the best place for this is in a leather pouch, in a purse or a backpack, and ready to go for someone that loves Polaroid's. It's very portable, it's easily rechargeable, and you can get a photo in under a minute. But you'll need to have space in that purse for more paper and at least one extra ink cartridge. And you'll want to buy those along with this as it only comes with 3 sheets of paper. 

The sequence to go from a digital photo to the printed variety can be a bit daunting at first when you pull out the instruction manual that is nearly the size of the printer itself. It's a beast and I wish some of that paper would have been used to provide more printing paper. Printing is much simpler than the size of the manual would suggest. The printer uses a QR code to connect directly to the printer itself. You can do some light editing in the app with some simple overlays and text. And that's fine. There are a ton of ways to edit photos with proprietary software already on the phone by the manufacturer. But I really want a way to print these without the border. However, even without that option the final prints are close to what a good ole' Polaroid is but a far better quality that will last longer.

Overall, this is excellent. It's a real niche product but it does a great job at what it does. It just comes at a bit of a premium.",1 year ago
677,678,6402214,SimpleLiving,5,Good mini portable printer,"I love this photo printer! It has many useful features that allow me to easily edit and print my pictures basically wherever I go. Since it comes with a rechargeable battery, it can be brought and charged wherever. The quality of the pictures is excellent! While the colors are slightly different, I love how great the pictures look and the size is so cute! I would say that this photo printer is best for personal use. It is perfect for crafts, to decorate living spaces, or simply just to have those memories in physical photographs. It was also a very cool experience to see the photos being made. The app worked well for me and the instructions were easy to follow. I would love to see more features added, like being able to print the pictures without the border or to include the date in the picture (the option is on the app, but did not work for me). You can add filters, borders, overlays, stickers, and texts using the app. You can also create layouts. The app could be improved by allowing users to find old pictures more easily. The paper tray capacity is 10 papers. After printing about 20 pictures, you will need to buy more photo papers and an ink cassette, which are sold together.

678,679,6402214,Txstatesal,5,Canon Does it in Style!,"I didn’t know I needed a portable printer to reinvigorate my passion for capturing memories and sharing it with family/friends! 

It’s not the most compact printer but because of the quality of photos it prints I would prefer to carry this with me wherever I go. 

I started with pics of the pups of course. They are my number one models and I have to have photos to show off to friends. I immediately printed two and put them in my planner at work so I can see my Frenchie everyday. 

Set up is easy, open the printer, put in the ink cassette and paper, download the application and pair your devices.

It’s just that simple. I’ve got a big team at work and they are silly so we’ve used the printer to make a cork board of team bonding photos! It’s been a hit!

679,680,6402214,SamG,4,Good Compact Photo Printer,"I have nothing particularly bad to say about the Selphy Square QX10. It’s simple, easy to use, and prints very high quality photos. The per photo cost feels like it’s on the high side, but it’s not too unreasonable.

The box includes the printer, USB charging cable, and a ‘sample’ pack of 3 sheets and an ink cartridge. I guess I shouldn’t have expected media to be included and you can get 20 sheets and a replacement ink cartridge for $15, so that’s about $.75 per photo. It doesn’t look like you can buy additional sheets or ink in any other quantity, so I assume one cartridge is good for 20 photos. The printer charges via an included micro-USB cable. Mildly disappointed they didn’t go with USB-C, but it’s not the end of the world. The printer itself is pretty compact and has a nice understated look that I appreciate. It’s nothing you could really keep on your person, but easily small enough to store in a drawer or bag when not in use.

Everything is done through the Selphy Photo Layout, which works pretty well and has some nice little embellishments you can add to the photo like frames and stamps. Your phone connects to the printer via a direct WiFi link that’s created when you scan a code on the ink cartridge door. Printing the actual photo takes about 45 seconds and you’ll see it come out in multiple stages as it applies the different color layers. The finished photos look really great and feel like they’ll hold up over time. You can also peel and stick them and the adhesive is light enough that you can pick them up and reposition them pretty easily. I could definitely see using these in a card or something similar to give it a personal touch. The photos are 2.7 x 2.7 inches and there’s about a .5” space below them to write a little note; part me does wonder if it would be possible to utilize that space for wider photos.

Overall I’m pretty happy with this printer. It’s sort of single purpose item, but it does what it does very well.",1 year ago

681,682,6402214,kwebbster,4,Good Photo Printer for What It Does,"The Casio Selphy Square photo printer does a really good job for what it does. It's just that what it does seems to be a niche market or hobby-type printer. The printer is a small dye-sublimation type printer, about the size of a large deck of cards or two. The paper, which is roughly the size of a playing card, loads from the bottom. The dye-sub film loads from the side. The whole thing is controlled by Casio Selphy app on your iPhone or Android phone. The app runs well and is pretty fool-proof and controls the Selphy. The printer spits the picture in and out so the film can print the different color shades until the finished product is done. The photos are outstanding and supposedly have a long life. Haven't verified that, but they do look good. The issue is they are really small and also have an adhesive so the photo can be used as a sticker... The film and photo paper is sold in matching packs, so when one runs out, all must be replaced. It comes the a sample pack, and more can be ordered through Casio or Best Buy. So for what it does, it really does a great job. Just not sure what you would want small sticker-photos for. Might be just what you are looking for, though.",1 year ago
682,683,6402214,GirlsCanTechToo,4,"Pricy, but simple and fun little printer","The Canon Selphy Square is a small, portable printer meant to print photos. I would call this a project printer. What makes this printer unique is the miniature ""Polaroid"" style prints it creates. This is a fun style to use in scrapbooks, bulletin boards (my project), or clipped to string. You can adjust the margin slightly to be thinner or thicker, but there will still be blank space at the bottom where you jot notes about the photo, write messages, or just leave blank. The photo itself, the part that is printed, is square. You could trim the bottom off and have a perfect square photo. You can also orient the picture so that the blank white space is on any side you want (great if you want the white part at the top so you can clip it to string.

Setup is relatively simple, so don't be intimidated when you remove an instruction book from the box that is nearly a 1/2 inch thick, covering a few pages of instructions in 24 languages! I used the first couple of pages to get familiar with the parts. The rest of the setup is done by downloading the app. Once the app is installed, it will walk you through the steps to setup the printer. Note that for your smart phone to connect to the printer, it will connect to the printer's own Wi-Fi network, so you may receive messages on your phone about whether you want to connect to that network (obviously, say yes), and later warning about the lack of an internet connection. The connection is only activated when printing, not while designing your printout or browsing your photos.

The app offers the option to print a single photo, or a collage layout of up to 3 photos. Adding more to your project will just start another printout. For such a simple printer, it has a quite a few adjustments and enhancements you can make. You can adjust the white margin, the position of the blank white area, adjust brightness/contrast/saturation, add frames, and even a handfull of ""stamps"" (among which includes a conversation bubble you can write in later).

Printing takes about 20 seconds. The printer will eject the photo almost all the way out as it prints one color at a time, making it fun to watch as the picture comes to life. You can also monitor the progress on your phone display. It can be handled immediately without waiting for ink to dry.

The starter kit that comes with the printer includes one cartridge and 3 sheets of paper. Additional kits can be purchased that include 20 sheets of paper and another cartridge. These are not ink cartridges, and they easily slide in and out of the printer. 

Overall, this is a bit of a pricey printer for what it does. It can only print on one size of paper, and uses proprietary supplies. However, if you enjoy printing photos for collages, scrapbooks, or just to have a fun way to display your photos, this is a simple, fast, and portable way to do it.",1 year ago
683,684,6402214,explore42,4,Photo Printer on the Go,"Canon Selphy QX-10 is a compact portable printer that I use to print photos on the go. The photos are smaller 2.7 inch square photos but the printer can reproduce up to 256 shades per color at a 287x287 dpi resolution. For the physical size of the photo the 287 dpi provides good resolution and the 256 shades provide vibrant colors with good depth and range. Overall I think the print quality is quite good and because it uses a dry imaging process the photos are ready to go as soon as they exit the printer. The printer only comes with 4 sheets of paper and a color cassette that will only print 4 photos so be sure to pick up a couple of boxes of Canon XS-20L with the printer, each one contains 20 sheets and a color cassette that will print 20 photos. One important feature of the photo paper is that you can peel off a back layer to expose a sticky back that allows you to stick your photos to things like an album or document. The sticky back is like the glue on blue painter’s tape so you can re-stick it a couple of times without having to worry about destroying the photo. Removing the back paper from the photo does take some time and good finger nails. The only negative as with most printers is the cost of supplies, if you aren’t careful you can go through a box of 20 very quickly especially if you like passing out photos.

Setup: The printer comes with a paper manual but I found that loading the Selphy Photo Layout app on my phone and following the directions in the app was better. The app walks you through all the steps from loading the paper and the color cassette to registering the printer using the QR code on the printer. I had the printer up and printing in very little time. The printer runs on an internal battery that uses a micro USB cable to charge. Canon provides the cable with the printer but does not supply a power adaptor so you will need to use either a spare adaptor or PC USB port to charge the printer. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge the printer and there is an LED indicator that gives battery status on the printer. You can also get the battery status by using the Selphy Photo Layout App. 

App and Operation: The Selphy Photo Layout app has some basic features that allow you to do some enhancements and editing to your photos. Once you select the photo you need to click on the image to align it and then you use the items in the ribbon menu to enhance it. I personally found it easier to use the photo editor on my phone to make any enhancements to the photo prior to using the Selphy app. Basically the Selphy Photo Layout app converts the photo to the size and resolution that the printer can print, it does not have to be the primary photo editing software unless you prefer to use it that way. Because the printer is totally wireless and does not have a memory card slot it makes printing photos from my Canon Powershot ELPH camera a little more difficult. To print those photos I download the images from the camera to my pc and then email them to myself. I then open the email on my phone and save the images to my phone’s photo Gallery. If you do this you have to make sure your photos don’t exceed your email’s limit on file size. The printer can have multiple devices registered, we have an Android phone, an Iphone and an IPAD all configured with the Selphy Photo Layout app and all can print. It takes slightly less than a minute to print the photo and you have to make sure the photo slot is not blocked because the printer feeds the photo paper out of and back into the printer several times during the printing process.",1 year ago
684,685,6402214,Ace254687,4,Great photo quality,"The Canon QX10 is controlled by a mediocre app, that uses limited WiFi - yet it prints some of the best photos that I have ever seen.

When I first opened the box to the Canon QX10, I saw that they included a sample ink cartridge and only 3 photo sheets, I was hoping more would’ve been included. There is also a charging cable and instructions to download the app. The printer has WiFi, but the only way to print is through the app, and it only connects directly to your phone by scanning the QR code on the printer itself. Therefor, you can’t connect the printer to your local WiFi network. 

Loading the ink cartridge and paper is very simple, there’s also visual instructions in the app if you need further help. The Canon Selphy app is the brains of the printer, this is the only way you’re able to print anything. The Selphy app isn’t the most advanced app out there, but it does offer a few features. For instance, you can add borders to your photos, resize it, add digital stamps, and frames. Once you have your photo selected and you’re ready to print it, this is when you connect it to your phone. This is the most bothersome thing about the whole process, sometimes it connects, sometimes it takes a few tries, either way its pretty slow. 

After you have your printer connected, you can begin to print. Once it prints, the photo will slide in and out of the printer about 3 times before it completes. I wish the instructions would have made a note, not to try and take the photo until its finished (I almost wasted one of my free prints). After I saw the final results of my photo, my jaw dropped...I couldn’t believe how clear and detailed the photo looked. Suddenly all of the issues I encountered didn’t matter anymore, this was the best looking photo I’ve ever seen. Not to mention, there is a clear film over the photo which makes it smudge and water droplet proof. A nice little feature about the photos are, you can peal the back off and it becomes a sticker. This is a great feature if you want to do a monthly baby-banner, for your baby’s first birthday. The photos are also the perfect size if you want to attach them to your fridge, either by magnets or sticking them directly to it. 

Overall, I did have some drawbacks at the beginning. Like the lack of full WiFi support, the mediocre app, and connecting the printer to my phone. Despite all the concerns I had, after seeing the final results of the pictures, I can definitely say this is one amazing printer. The photo quality is just spectacular, plus the smudge/teardrop proof film coating really makes these little square treasures priceless. I would definitely recommend this printer to anyone looking to capture precious moments.",1 year ago

688,689,6402214,callmeageeth,4,"Solid printer, needs more customization options","IN THE BOX
Inside you will find the printer, USB cable, the “toner” cartridge and 3 sample sheets of paper. 

SETUP
Super easy. I recommend charging it completely which takes a few hours. Loading the paper and ink cartridge is easy. The printer is designed so you can’t mess it up. Meaning, the ink cartridge only goes in one spot (on the side of the printer) and it won’t fit if you put it in the wrong way. The paper loads on the bottom of the printer. The door where the paper goes is easy to open and there’s a little label there telling you to make sure the back of the paper is facing up (up when you load it, facing down when you lay the printer right side up). The paper has Canon logos on the back, so again, it’s pretty intuitive. 

From here you have to download the SELPHY app (NOTE: there’s a lot of Canon apps out there, so make sure you download the right one). In the app, you click on the “add printer” icon at the top left and select SELPHY SQUARE QX10 and if your printer is on, it will add quickly. 

PRINT QUALITY
Before I get into the ease of use, which is what prevents this product from getting 5 stars, I wanted to discuss the print quality. Now, first things first. I would assume most people know this by looking at the printer itself, but it is not going to print 4X6 prints. These are pocket size, squarish photos that are relatively small. Other printers (looking at you HP Sprocket) can take a photo and using 4 pages, create one larger photo. The SELPHY, to my knowledge, doesn’t have that capability. But the photo paper have an adhesive backing so you can use it as a sticker, which is honestly, what I think it’s made for.

Putting those inherent limitations aside, the printing quality is fantastic. The printer spits the paper out and pulls it back in several times (I believe applying different colors during each pass) and the end result is a fantastic looking picture. The HP Sprocket I mentioned above, doesn’t utilize an “ink cartridge” because the ink is somehow contained in the paper (which is why that printer is smaller). While I find the Sprocket printer to produce a good photo, I can confidently say the SELPHY produces a better result. 

EASE OF USE
Now, the setup is easy, the printing quality is bad, but what holds this printer back is the app. It’s not terrible, it’s not even bad. But I’ve found most of Canon’s apps to be a little clunky with outdated visuals. I must admit it’s easy to navigate. It just feels limited.

After the printer is connected, you open the app and you get an option to either “select and print” or “n-up layout.” Select and print is pretty obvious, you pick a photo you want (you must select from various folders where your photos are located). I’m not sure what n-up means, but it’s basically a collage. Some people might like it, but given that the paper is so small, I prefer to print one photo to one piece of paper. 

After you select a photo, you are then given options to customize it. Now, the printer by default treats a photo like a polaroid photo. Meaning, there’s a larger white border at the bottom. You can customize the photo by moving the position of the photo, putting a timestamp, putting frames, graphics as stamps, texts, and filters. While I think the selection of TYPES of things you can do to customize your photos is sufficient, I was disappointed with the options WITHIN the types. Frames for example, there’s only 9 options. Without seeing it, it might seem like I’m complaining about minor stuff, but the 9 options available just don’t appeal to me. Most are just bright colors. 

Bottomline is that the app could and should be able to offer you more customization. 

CONCLUSION
At the end of the day, this is a well built, easy to use printer that makes small photos that are best used as stickers. If you can live with just printing pictures, you absolutely won’t be disappointed. The quality is terrific. But if you’re one looking to truly customize your photos, you will be left slightly disappointed.",1 year ago

693,694,6452568,teasten,4,"Impressed, HP+ is great value but not mandatory","Impressed, HP+ is good value, not mandatory 

HP+: I was previously suspicious of HP Instant Ink, but HP's new offering HP+ is infinitely better, fairer, and offers real value. Out of the box, if you sign up to HP+ you get 6 months of free ink and 1500 pages per month. This is more than fair and enough to work out what the right HP+ would be best for your needs. And if you're not interested in HP+ you don't have to have it and just buy genuine HP cartridges instead. The lowest HP+ cost is $1.99 a month for 50 pages. Which be enough for most home use and since you can upgrade downgrade plans, I am confident that when everyone is back in the office we will be able to manage HP+ effectively. By my math though, HP+ makes sense for me. One of the benefits is that HP+ also doubles the warranty (2 years) and invests in re-forestation for every page you print. So it's effectively a green printing subscription - which I personally like. I am actually surprised HP doesn't market this benefit more. See the image uploaded I screenshotted from the HP+ app.

Setup: The HP M234dwe supports 802.11n and setup is all done via the app. Setup was surprisingly easy, probably the best setup experience ever for a wireless printer.

Print Quality: Print quality is great. It's a 600dpi laser, so you can't fault the quality. The speed of the M234dwe is rated at 30ppm. Which kind of makes me laugh, because on the base HP+ plan that means you could go through your 50 monthly pages in 2min. You can print via AirPrint on the iPhone/iPad - which is a huge plus for me.

Scan Quality: The M234dwe Scanner is 600dpi as well. I like that you can scan from the app straight to your phone. Such a game-changer, no more firing up my PC when I just want to scan a page to email to someone or keep a copy of a receipt.

Other Thoughts: I didn't know where to put this, but hope it helps someone. There are some weird design decisions. The paper try design is weird. Parts of it fold up, some clip-on, and it's not completely enclosed so there's an open slot at the front. I really don't know what HP was going for with the M234dwe but I really wish it was a fully enclosed tray that fit neatly under the print and didn't stick out a few inches from the front. I also don't like the little LCD screen that just shows error codes. It's not intuitive and while you can get all of the real information from the app. I wish, so much, that it was a more useful screen or just HP got rid of it altogether. Printers that show error codes should be a thing of the past. These are not reasons not to buy, just to let others know. I am still very happy with the printer.",7 months ago
694,695,6452568,Patrick,5,Better Than I Imagined,"Over 20 years ago I purchased the HP Laserjet 1100. It lasted over 10 years and never wore out. I packaged it up, and it is still sitting in my closet to this day because it is still a great printer. Of course, I replaced it with another HP laser printer.And have never purchased anything but HP printers since.

I was excited about getting the LaserJet M234dwe Wireless Black-and-White Laser Printer because of all the positive feedback. I was not disappointed. 

The printer came via FedEx, and was packed so well that it could probably withstand a drop from several stories...but I'm not going to be the one to test that out. As with most printers, it had a bit of prepping to do to get it ready, such as removing all the tape, cardboard, etc.The actual physical setup was super easy after that.

Now, the installation of the software was a bit tedious...not horrible, but like I said, a bit tedious. But once I got the HP Smart app installed, I realized it was well worth the wait. It is one of the best printer apps I have ever used...it is so well thought out and designed that it is truly a do-it-all printing/scanning app. You can change the settings on the printer, set up new connections, add new printers, scan, EVERYTHING. And it is super easy to switch between all your HP printers and scanners. I actually have three HP printers for my home-based business, and I can control all of them from this one app,

THE PRINTING
The quality of the printing is flawless...whether it be simple letterhead, or complex forms, the text and images are SUPER CRISP. For kicks and giggles I decided to print three photos. What can I say except I was amazed by the clarity. Of course the printouts were not photo quality, but for black and white laser printing, they were amazing.

There is a short wait before the actual printing begins. This is completely normal and is in no way out of line. But it is noticeable. Once the print starts, however, it is lightning fast, and I do mean fast. Multiple pages print in no time at all. 

HP offers an ink and a toner replacement program that in the past I have not participated in. However, I decided to sign on this time around. They offer SIX MONTHS of free toner...SIX MONTHS! And they offer several different usage options, such as 100 pages per month, all the way up to over 1,000 pages per month. I don't know if you have ever purchased a toner cartridge, but I realized really quickly that there is no way to lose with the automatic toner replacement. Plus, they give you 1,500 pages for the first six months (the trial period). 

I am nothing but IMPRESSED with this printer. It is a huge asset to my home office, and it is so well-built and solid that I expect it will end up in the closet with my HP 1100 in about ten years. Seriously, I hate to sound all gushy over a printer, but THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY!

I would recommend this to anybody wanting/needing a superior laser printer.",7 months ago
695,696,6452568,stevefromtheburbs,5,EXCELLENT PRINTER/SCANNER - CAN ONLY USE HP TONER,"This printer/copier/scanner is truly an amazing piece of engineering marvel. It is a very nice machine, It really is impressive and when you take it out of the box, you'll see what I mean. It is sturdy, more like a small refrigerator than a printer/copier/scanner in that it is very rock solid. Not junky or cheesy. Very impressed. 

Setup could not be easier. Follow the link to the app, download, open, and follow the instructions step by step, to connect to your wifi network for wireless printing. 

You'll hit a speed bump in the setup because of the HP+ thing. I feel like I'm held hostage because it is like you have to sign up for this to be able to print. Even if you don't give your credit card for the free toner/subscription thing, you have to sign up and agree that you'll never use a non-HP toner cartridge (in fairness, it does say this on the label and maybe the box too). I felt trapped, like I had to sucumb to this thing I didn't really want to do right now, I just wanted to print, scan, enjoy my new purchase and not get bound up in these types of monumental decisions. Would be best saved for after you have a chance to use the machine, feel good about it, and then sign up. 

As for the printer, it prints fast, nice, and with great quality. Seriously nice. Scanning? I was able to scan a necessary document, name it, and export it to Acrobat as a PDF within record time. Seriously fast. And high quality too. Need a quick copy of something, fast, easy, and no worries. I love this machine, it is really nice, solid, no quirks or problems. And my lights did not dim in the house when it printed as was the case with laser printers of yesteryear. 

The buttons for copy/scan, etc. are easy and intuitive. The app is more than intuitive. The paper feed is open, not a tray, and I like that alot. I hate pulling out that darn tray and all that - with this, just slide some more paper into the slot and you are good to go. Easy. 

Removing/changing the toner cart and fixing jammed paper if you get any, will be super easy. I was able to pull the toner cart out and required no effort or ""tech"" to do...jams will be able to be seen during the travel path once the cover is open. Super easy, super friendly to those in your home or office who fix these things when a jam eventually happens. I noticed this had very surefooted paper feeding, no wishy washy misfeeds - it took the paper in confidently! 

Back to the HP+ thing. After you realize that the normal yield cartridge costs $50 and the high yield one costs $75, you start to think, I hate going to buy it and spending so much at one time. The HP+ per page/toner subscription is reasonably priced and frankly a much easier pill to swallow as they say, rather than rolling up to your local office supply store to spend $75 on a Saturday afternoon. Just pay each month, and then when you need a new cart, they send it to you. Return the old one, and it is just automated and easy. Seems to be a discounted price to print per page, than to buy a cartridge at retail. So in the end, a good value, just don't want to be bogged down during the setup. 

You will never go wrong with HP. Their stuff works and it works well. You must realize and accept, you'll only be able to use HP carts along the way and either sign up for HP+, or maybe someone will offer up a cart with an old chip in it so you can save printing costs - buyer beware, those knock off or reloaded carts are always a bad business decision with the quality of what you receive - at least that has been my experience in the past. 

As we move towards being more ""online"" and less printing of things, my guess is that printer companies need to capture their market share now and keep users on board before they fall off the edge and go mostly online. Just thinking out loud. Trust me when I tell you I would be team HP all the way, because I know their stuff works, lasts forever, and frankly were there with me from the early days. I trust HP and I know you will love this product. Just don't think you'll be able to cheap out and get knock off toner for less - it clearly says no non-HP carts can be used. But accepting the HP+ plan, seeing the rates, makes sense. And to know it'll arrive when I need it, makes me a bigger fan in the end.",7 months ago
696,697,6452568,APFLORES413,5,Great and precise,"I am always on the lookout for a good and reliable laser printer for my home office and kids school needs. I was glad that HP came out with this M234dwe laser printer which met all of our needs. The beauty about this compared to my other laser printer is the ability to utilize HP Smart app, so I can print from anywhere in the house as long as I am connected to the WiFi and printer itself. 

Opening up the box, you are met with his nice compact, but not too large/small printer. It is a solid build and fits in my desk nicely. Connecting it to my WiFi and to the HP Smart app was easy and flawless. There was no need to print up a page with the printer WiFi code (compared to other HP ink printers). You also have 6 months free toner through the HP Smart app which we would need with all of the printing needs due to home learning and working at home. 

I was amazed at how fast this printer is in printing both one-sided and double-sided pages. I was able to print up my dtr’s history work (about 20 pages) in under a minute. The quality of the print is also excellent, and I noticed when using better quality paper with 24lbs makes a whole lot of difference. And through the app, you can scan to the cloud straight to any cloud based sites/apps that you use. As I use both Google Drive and Dropbox, the app makes it easy to upload for you to save and print later on. Using the scanner, you are able to scan up to 600x600 resolution. 

On the top of the printer you have the glass scanner which dominates the entire landscape. The only problems that I have is the glowing light right below the HP sign. The light is about 2 inches long and changes color. I still don’t know the purpose of this light but it is distracting at night (my office is also my bedroom) and there is no way to turn it off unless I unplug it. Also, the cover for the paper tray is very flimsy and can get knocked out of line easily. 

Overall, I am very happy with this printer and can’t wait to see how easy it is to enact the new toner before the 6months are up.",7 months ago
697,698,6452568,PhillipB,4,Solid HP Laser. Not good Android setup.,"Ok. I am a long time HP fan. I still own 2 dinosaur laser printers 1020 and color laser 2600n. I have owned these printers for over 10 now and they still work after many toner cartridges later. 

I still use the 1020 for BW till this day. So my love for HP is there.

Fast forward to today and this model. 

 Pros:
Sleek
Modern Look
Multifunction with scanner
HP+ free ink for 6 months and extended warranty.
Customer service was friendly and they actually figured out the setup issue.

Cons:
Let's get this out of the way. Setup was a pain. I tried to setup with Android mobile and it was a no go. I reset per the instructions and it was a a no go. I conceded and called help on HP. After 1.5 hours with mobile support I had to take out a PC. Apparently this new model has a flaw with Android registration to HP+ and it needed a windows based PC to get over this issue.
Second Con is I had to enter my payment information in order to get HP+. Not too fond of this but ok. Wished it had scan to cloud feature. Scan to device is easy to use with app.

After setup was complete. I registered the printer on all my devices.
Kid's Chrome books
Mine and my wife's surfaces
Mine and my wife's android phones

And we were up and running.

If it wasn't for the setup issue I would give this printer 5 stars.

Afterwards you can print from your PC or you can also download the HP smart app to your phone, add the printer there and you can print from your phone too.

It includes one toner; however, it does come with 6 months of free toner via their HP+ subscription, afterwards you can sign up for different plans/levels so you can get your toner delivered to you automatically when its needed.

It has a paper auto feeder on the bottom with see thru gray dust cover (real nice) just for printing though, it also has a flatbed scanner where you can scan/copy documents (no auto feeder on this one though, you must place each document one by one).

700,701,6452568,KMed,5,A Fitting LaserJet For Home Use,"Printers aren’t as essential of a PC accessory these days, but they still serve a purpose and have actually come a long way since the old inkjets that you’d find in most people’s homes. This HP LaserJet M234dwe is a fantastic budget multifunction laser printer for the masses. When you need to print or scan a document it’s very convenient to have the ability to do it at home and not have to find a place to print your documents, so that’s why I’ve always opted to have a printer around, even if seldom used.

This HP LaserJet has a scanner built into it, ethernet and wireless connectivity and it comes in a tiny package that doesn’t take up much more room than an inkjet printer. The advantages of this being a laser printer are numerous. Your prints come out without any smearing, instantly and toner lasts much longer than ink, especially when not being used. Toner doesn’t just dry up as many inkjet cartridges do. The only disadvantage to this HP LaserJet is that it’s limited to black and white printing. This wasn’t a concern for me as if I want to print out photos I’d go somewhere else to have them printed.

The setup process for this printer was a bit different as I ended up doing most of it on my phone through the HP Smart app. The instructions were easy to follow and the app guides you through everything. You also end up getting 6 months of free toner, which really means signing up for HP’s toner replacement program which monitors your usage and bills you for the toner they send out. As a matter of fact I already received notification that a new toner cartridge is on the way. Their pricing model seems fair and let’s you adjust it to suit your printing needs. We don’t print a lot at home, but it’s nice to have the option to be billed on a monthly basis instead of spending a lot at one time for a replacement toner. You always have the option of not enrolling in the program and just buying your toner the old school way as well, so don’t let that deter you.

Printing is pretty straight forward. Windows 10 will detect the HP LaserJet M243 once it’s on the network and install the HP Smart app for you. It’s really a no brainer, unless you want to scan wirelessly as well. This does require you to sign up for an HP account as the scanning actually takes place in the cloud and not locally. You also have the option to be able to print from anywhere, which may be convenient for some and works well, but I turned off this feature. Scanning worked well and I didn’t notice anything different than when I was scanning locally on a separate scanner that I owned.

So here’s the breakdown of the pros and cons of the HP LaserJet M234dwe.

Pros:
Small footprint
Easy setup
Prints most documents instantly
Easy to use
HP+ Toner program might entice some users (6 months free toner)
Scanning was crisp and clear
Printing was clear and sharp

Cons:
HP+ program may discourage others who may not realize they don’t need to enroll
Scanning wireless is a little different and requires an HP account

Overall I really liked the ease of use, setup and quality of this HP LaserJet M234dwe. I really wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a capable laser printer for a home or small office.",7 months ago
701,702,6452568,sollyp,4,Worth it for the office? Depends,"This printer is truly meant for the office that needs a fair amount of black and white documents. The HP LaserJet M234dwe is a great value all-in-one MONOCHROME printer for the office. I must emphasize monochrome because it is for the office (or for the rare home) that only needs black and white documents. It does come with some caveats.

Unboxing the HP LaserJet was typical HP, nothing special. Inside the box is the printer, toner cartridge, power cord, and the always required papers/manuals/guides. The size and weight of the printer are pretty average. There is a tiny 1.27” display that display minimal information.

Setup was unfortunately not as straightforward as I would have liked it to be. You have to install the HP Smart software from their website as well as make an account to use it. You also have to setup the printer with each device that you are going to print with, whether that is your phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, etc. HP is obviously investing heavily into the online connectivity/wireless capabilities. However, this can be very annoying to someone who just wants a quick print. However, for office computers that are always going to be there, this isn’t a huge drawback. Interestingly enough, they clearly discourage wired usage as no USB cord is included. There is a USB port but you still need internet and the aforementioned HP software and account to print. So this is a printer that purely depends on internet. Once again, this may be fine for businesses with constant internet access but not for the casual local printer. 

In terms of the specs, there is no automatic document feeder for the scanner. This may be inconvenient for the office that needs to scan/send and copy multiple documents. The paper tray holds 150 sheets, and the output holds 100 sheets. I was impressed with the print speed. The advertised 30 ppm is indeed true. This is faster than most other printers in this class for sure. For more complex documents needing gradient backgrounds, it is definitely much slower. I would say its closer to 10-12 ppm. This is not as impressive. The quality of the prints are nothing to laugh at. The text is crisp and readable at all font sizes. There is minor banding with the gradient backgrounds but it is definitely more than passable.

So I am not as big a fan of subscription programs like HP+. It gives you an extra year of warranty for 2 years total and 6 months of free toner. You are also locked into buying HP toner for the rest of the life of the printer as the printer will not work with generics. Essentially, this locks you into their ecosystem. In addition, this printer does not give you the option of opting out of HP+. For SOME, HP+ absolutely can be affordable if you print close to the monthly limits. Otherwise, it can be not as worth it.

All in all, this is a good monochrome office printer for some. It's pretty fast for basic text and prints are good quality. It does come with the wireless requirements and HP+ but these may not be drawbacks for everyone. 

Pros:
Very fast for its class with 30 ppm 
Good print quality
Wireless capabilities
HP+ adds one more year to warranty for 2 total years, and free recycling
HP+ may be worth it if you print basically close to the page limits each month

Cons:
Requires internet and HP account to function
Virtually no wired capabilities – no local printer use 
Initial setup can be annoying and has to be done with every device
Slower at complex prints at around 10-12 ppm
No automatic document feeder for scanner/copier

702,703,6452568,Josh,5,Great printer for basic wireless needs!,"Great printer. Does exactly what we bought it for extremely well—air printing. So easy to just print something you need right from your phone or iPad, wirelessly! We also looked into the HP instant ink subscription and decided to go with it, despite being very opposed to subscription services almost all the time. They have very affordable options, including the one we went with ($1.99/month). We don’t do a ton of printing so that setup will work great for us. Best of all, you don’t have to pay any more than your monthly subscription cost for ink/toner and shipping is all free. Lot better than forking over $30-$50+ for a toner cartridge replacement",1 day ago
703,704,6452568,TechGuru,4,Affordable Compact AIO High Perf Wireless Printer,"HP LaserJet MFP M234dwe is designed for use in small to medium home office that need print, copy and scan in monochrome laser print technology. This printer is an all-in-one monochrome printer in a super compact form factor that doesn’t take more desk space. 

Its small but powerful, measures around 14.5 x 11.8 x 9.5in and weighs 17 lbs. Printer is surprising faster with the two-sided printing and very suited for high volume printing. With kids doing online schooling, working from home with this printer for print requirements is very reliable. 

What’s in the box: Printer, Toner (approx. 700 pages), setup guide, power cord. No USB cables are included as this is a HP+ machine that requires an HP account, ongoing internet connection and use of HP toner cartridges to work.

Setup is fairly simple and seamless with the HP smart app that guides each step by step to get connected wirelessly. Download the app from the Appstore or play store and follow the instructions for setup. You will need a mobile or tablet or computer for setup as the USB port at the back is not supported and recommended to setup using WIFI. On the top there is a small 1.27” LCD for display and has support to apple air print to print from apple devices. Works well with both windows and mac OS and doesn’t need any separate drivers to get started. Since this printer is connected to internet you can print it from anywhere. It can hold 150 sheets of paper in the paper tray and does not support automatic document feeder for scanning multiple documents at once. HP advertises print speed of 30ppm and 20000 pages monthly duty cycle but that is only with minimal text and largely depends on the content that is printed. 

Print quality is great with sharp texts and graphics. Only con is this model does not support generic toners and would need genuine original HP toner cartridges to work. HP+ you will get a free 6-month toner supply and 1-year extended warranty on top of manufacturers warranty, if you sign up for the service. 

If you print a lot then the service may be value add for toner replacement but there is no additional savings for subscription as HP+ tracks and bills based on number of pages printed. 

Pros: Affordable low price for all-in-one, compact footprint, high performance printing, smartphone integration, instant ink with HP+, free 6 months toner, 1-year extended warranty with HP+

Cons: Lack of automatic document feeder, no generic toner option, small paper tray, small LCD viewer.

Bottom-line: Good affordable home or small office all-in-one Wi-Fi printer with the option of HP+.",7 months ago
704,705,6452568,RalphHenry,5,"Crisp Printing, Laser with Scanner","Very solid laser printer, easy to install and easy to use. First laser printer I have had with a scanner. I can use this laser printer to copy a page of a document much faster than my inkjet printers can do. I feel it is very nice to have a monochrome laser printer and an inkjet both. When you are printing or just copying black/white material, it is more economical to use the laser printer. When I need color, then I use the inkjet. Laser printers have a toner cartridge and won’t dry out like inkjet cartridges might if not used enough. 
A laser printer comes into play a lot for me when just creating a quick memo with grocery list, a name, a picture/map, a street address etc. I’d rather make a word file and print it than jot it down by hand. Others may find this useful also. I hesitate sometimes to do this with an inkjet since I don’t want to ‘waste the ink’; but with the laser I have no such compunction.
HP Smart software makes it a cinch to install the printer via smartphone or from a PC. The install process even finds your WiFi password but is secure in that it does require you to be near to push a button on the printer to be sure it is you. 
There is a unique feature of a status light. The color tells you several things including if you are properly connected, have a problem or if the unit is busy or updating. There are also several intuitive buttons to make a copy, cancel a job, etc. 
The interface is clean and nicely annotated. 
The unit prints very well, crisp and clear. The footprint is smaller than most inkjet printers and smaller than my older HP LaserJet, even though it has more features and has the scanner.
I use printers a lot to avoid making written notes. I do recommend this well designed, high quality and moderately priced printer to use in conjunction with your inkjet to help with many tasks – wonderful.",7 months ago

706,707,6452568,Christopher,5,Delivers,"I have always wanted a LaserJet for my home office but due to pricing I have normally opted for a desk jet. I normally make this decision for two main reasons. Number one, inkjets tend to be significantly cheaper than LaserJets. Number two, the general consensus thought is that toner does cost more than ink. Whereas this is hardly the case we all tend to think that way if uninitiated. With the HP - LaserJet M234dwe with HP+ this conundrum is solved and no longer vexing. The printer is economically priced and whereas toner is still relative and respectively priced, the HP+ allows access to the instant-ink program for 6 months free. The program does cost after that, but the benefit is that in an office setting managers and associates can spend time improving the business and not squandered ordering supplies. Also, with HP+ you get an extended 2-year warranty. The printer is not nearly as large as I thought it was going to be. Which is a super plus not having a large eye sore of a printer. About the only con I have for this printer is the bland design. I like that it is smaller in statue however the cosmetic design vibe is a bit early 2000’s tech. But, printing wise it Delivers like its larger counter parts. I have this in a home office but really wanted to run like a small office might, so I had it print a novel 4 times in a row for me. The printer handled it with ease and every page was vibrant and dark. The printer is not exactly quiet, but it is not annoyingly loud either. But where this machine absolutely outshines even my high-end professionally maintained devices at my office, is through the HP Smart App. The app is easy to download on any resource phone, tablet, or computer and takes the media helm for documents. I just envisioned a small office where the smart app works like an expensive server client. But better because you can do it from devices as well not just computers.

708,709,6452568,Jaron,3,Both overcomplicated and oversimplified,"THE GOOD
-Overall compact size
-Good print speed
-Nice network and remote print options
-Extended warranty and free ink is nice

THE BAD
-Needlessly complicated setup process
-Requires internet connection and HP account to even function
-Can't function as standalone printer
-Bright standby light
-No on-device menu or controls
-Open-front paper tray isn't kid friendly
-Miserable online support
-Mobile Android application doesn't work well with non-16:9 display devices

THE TL/DR
It's a fine B&W laser printer for the less technically inclined who want someone else to manage everything about the printer. For computer power users and those who like configuring and managing their computers and networks, the HP+ requirements are frustrating and clunky.

THE DETAILS
I've had numerous problems with ink jet printers clogging recently because I don't print nearly as many pages now as I did five years ago. Not only can the ink in the cartridges dry out, the ink in the print heads will dry and clog everything if you don't use it often enough. As I rarely need color printing, and toner basically can't dry out, an in expensive B&W laser printer seemed like a great alternative. Getting one with six months of free toner and an extra year on the warranty looked like a bonus. However a lot of frustrations started shortly after unboxing.

Despite HP having a driver-only download available on their site, ( which I prefer since I like manually configuring my peripherals and don't need extra ""management"" applications running in the background ) this printer will not function without the entire HP Smart suite. You can install the driver, and Windows will see the printer, but anything sent to the printer stalls in the queue and won't print. Instead you must install HP Smart and you must register an account with HP. I have no problem with HP requiring an account as part of the bonus toner promo, but needing an account internet access for the printer to even operate seems rather harsh.

Part of the reasons for the online connectivity is because of the remote printing capabilities. With the HP app on your phone or tablet, you can send documents to your printer anywhere you have internet access. For confidential documents, it also has a private pickup option that you can queue up a print job remotely from your phone, but it won't actually print until you're at the printer in person. To use private pickup, you must also take that same phone or tablet to the printer, and you must allow the mobile app to have access to your phone's location services and Bluetooth.

However, back to the install process, you have to pair the printer with each mobile device from which you want to print. To repeat, part of the setup process before you use the printer for the very first time ( from any device ) is to run the HP Smart application, create an HP account, and then link your specific printer to your account. When you run the HP Smart app on your phone, you have to log in using that same HP account. I initially set up my printer using a desktop. When I tried using my phone, sure enough my printer was listed as registered to my account, but it was not listed as a printer on my device. I had to go through the setup and discovery process again on my phone. Finally, I had to install another application onto my phone ( HP print plugin ) in order to even print. That last requirement isn't shown on the sparse documentation you get with the printer ( which only says go to 123.hp.com ). You have to dig through the FAQs and online help to find it.

If you want to forgo the network and online capabilities and requirements and just have a normal, local-only printer, you can't. Though it can be hooked to your computer over USB, it still must be connected to a network and access HP in order to work. Why a USB printer should ever NEED to be connected to a network is beyond me. The USB port is also covered by a sticker, and on quick glance it looks like it isn't even there. It's as if HP is actively discouraging the USB operation mode. Then why even put the USB port on it in the first place?

As I mentioned above, it's nice that the HP+ gets you some free extra ink and an extra year of warranty coverage. Buying the printer gets you six months HP+ service for free, after which you need to pay for it if you want to continue. The subscription cost is based on how many pages you print a month. The more pages you print, the more your pay per month, and the more often they send you replacement toner. At least, that's what it seems like to me, none of the info I read in the app or on HP's site made it perfectly clear. Part of this service is also additional online monitoring of your printer ( HP calls it a security watch ), and yes, it HP does track every page you print. So depending on how comfortable you are with HP knowing your printing habits, this might not bother you at all or seem very Big Brother. I'm not suggesting HP is tracking the exact contents of what you print, only the page count, but it does seem like an awful lot of telemetry gathered for just a printer. Also, if you ever use a non-HP toner cartridge in the printer, it will void the warranty and your HP+ service.

Other small niggles is the absence of any kind of reasonable control panel or menu system on the printer itself ( everything has to be configured and managed from the HP application ), the rather bright display status light ( it's rather annoying at night ), and a paper tray that is fully open at the front ( not terribly protective to keep the print paper clean from environmental spills or curious children ).

For a recommendation, it can go either way. For someone who wants the speed and convenience of a laser printer in a reasonably small package and pay someone else to manage everything about it, it's a decent choice. For anyone who likes to manage their own computers and peripherals and just wants a basic network-capable laser printer, a lot of the HP+ requirements seem rather invasive and restrictive. You can get a non-HP+ version of the printer ( it's the one without an ""e"" in the model number ), but you'll tend to pay more for that model because HP is heavily discounting these right now.",7 months ago
709,710,6452568,dharr18,4,Very Nice,"This is a very nice printer. Setup was a little wonky, I had to play with the buttons and power off once before I could get the setup working. I am guessing configuring from a PC would have been easier.

The Android and IPhone apps are very well designed with maybe too many options. Luckily you can modify the tiles that show.

Once you actually connects to the printer, configuration is simple and straight forward. 

The first firmware update appeared to hang but completed without issue. I just needed to restart the app.

Connecting from Chrome OS is simple. It just finds the printer without issue.

Windows required a install from the Microsoft Store. I prefer exe downloads but the app works fine.

Print quality is fantastic. The print speed is great. It is just as you would expect from a laser printer. Double sided printing works very well.

The scanner is fast and creates nice images.

The paper tray is a odd design. It works but I prefer a closed tray.

Design:
While the HP Neverstop is no breakthrough in terms of design, it looks great in my home, and there are a few things that deserve to be pointed out. First, the setup was surprisingly simple. It is all done through the HP Smart App, which has a step by step guide to get the printer added to your Wi-Fi network. Within just a couple of minutes, I had the printer setup on both my laptop and smartphone. Second, the toner level is displayed on the front of the printer. Out of the box, the printer includes toner that can last an estimated 5,000 pages before a reload is needed. When the time comes to do the reload, you can purchase a toner reload kit and use it to reload the toner, which takes a few seconds. I like that this printer is cartridge-free. Third, this printer is compact. Multifunction laser printers can be quite large, but not the HP Neverstop. It is one of the most compact printers I have seen on the market, and it fits well on my desk. Overall, I think this is a well-designed printer. The design and easy setup left me with a very positive first impression.

Features & Performance:
I was surprised by how quickly and quietly the HP Neverstop prints pages at such high quality. On average, it prints about 21 pages per minute. The text is crisp and legible. Images look good, but this printer is not designed for high-quality image and photo printing. One drawback is that it only prints in black in white, but since my primary use for this printer is to print text documents it works well for my needs. With the HP Smart App, printing, scanning, copying and other tasks can be done from just about anywhere. I have found the app to be reliable and easy to use. There is a slight delay when printing wirelessly compared to printing from a computer that is hard-wired into the printer, but I think the convenience that wireless connectivity provides makes up for that delay. Aside from no color printing, this printer has all the features I was looking for in a printer.

Verdict:
The HP Neverstop accomplishes printing tasks quickly and quietly. Everything from initial setup to using all of its features is user friendly. It is versatile, reliable and cost-efficient. The HP Neverstop truly never stops providing for my printer needs, and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a multifunction black and white laser printer.",1 year ago
715,716,6401101,JKinSYR,5,HP makes another solid printer for the win,"This HP printer feels like a solid and well-made unit that provides a great business like look while sitting in my home office. I unboxed this and had it up and running within a short time. HP offers an app that I would highly recommend because it helps to streamline the setup and daily usage of the printer. This printer has a nice and compact footprint for its laser ability and was actually a bit smaller than my previous HP ink printer.
 
This is my first laser printer at home, and I am truly impressed. Having the 1 toner cartridge that comes with this and being able to get 5000 pages of printouts from it is something I’m looking forward to. I have always dreaded having to pay for ink cartridges with previous printers and they were never affordable for me. This printer has been super-efficient for my home office and personal family usage for school at home. This HP printer can zip through and pump out sheet after sheet of printouts in a matter of seconds. The scanning and copy functions work seamlessly as well.
 
I have an iPhone XR and the HP Smart App works well on it. Being able to print photos and documents from my device with the app is quick and efficient. From my laptop or tablet I can easily print on Wi-Fi as well and this feature makes my life so much easier. Not having to be hardwired to a printer for business like print quality is amazing. I love having this printer for its premium laser printing and its speed. I have not felt slowed down with productivity or with Wi-Fi printing issues. This HP printer is excellent so far and I am impressed.",1 year ago
716,717,6401101,Mike777VSP,5,Impressive!,"First things first, I am an HP (printers/copiers) guy. I have tried other brands and it seems I always drift back to HP. When I received the Neverstop and saw the size of the box it came in, my initial impression was it will never sit on the desk, it will be to BIG! Boy was I wrong. It fits like a hand to a glove, as the old saying goes, “don’t judge a book by its cover” applies to the Neverstop printer. And once I unpackaged it, the first thing I noticed was the color, its aesthetically pleasing. I was very impressed. 

Do yourself a favor and download the HP Smart App before you remove it from the box. (I didn’t). The app setup is simple, as is the pairing of the Neverstop. In literally 5 minutes I had it connected to all my devices, laptop, iPad, iPhone 7+, (even my son’s Surface Pro). It is so SIMPLE! 

Pros:

Layout - I love how the Neverstop is laid out, HP engineering did a fantastic job. The toner level is on the front of the printer and is easy to see and read. The paper load is easy to get to. Everything is in the right place. (Thanks HP) Again, if you judge it by the box sitting on the shelf, you may think it’s going to be HUGE, its not, its probably the sleekest, compact laser printer I’ve seen. The Neverstop looks like a midget compared to the laser printer at our office. I love the color, its a vibrant white, and it blends in so well with our other furniture in our home office. 

Toner:
The box and instructions say right out of the box you can print 5,000 pages, before needing new toner. This printer doesn’t have a cartridge, it uses a reload kit that you purchase, and its not like other printers that you wear gloves to keep from getting toner everywhere. Its simple, precise, and again, HP put it in the “right spot”. Its easily accessible. Also, in the description on Best Buy for this printer, it specifically says, “Don't worry about toner - with the revolutionary HP Neverstop all-in-one laser printer 1202w, get up to 60% savings on toner every time you reload and up to 5,000 pages of toner right out of the box....”

Noise:
It is surprisingly very quiet. I was printing a couple of pages (wirelessly) and had to go see if it was printing, it was that quiet. Yes you can hear the internal “workings” of the printer, but its not noisy at all. 

Printing:
The Neverstop is about average when it comes to printing. Its not as fast as the laser printer we have at our office, but for our home use its all that we need. The printing quality is very good, and in my opinion better than the laser jet at our office. 

Cons:
The only “complaint” that I have is this, NO COLOR PRINTING! For our home use, that is not a big deal to me, my wife prints a lot of recipes that she uses, and she wants color printing, my 16 year old son, at times needs color prints for school, most of my work is black and white. So as a personal preference, it doesn’t bother me, it is an issue for my spouse and son. 

Final verdict:

IMPRESSIVE! The Neverstop is an all around great printer. If you want a sleek, quiet, black & white printer, don’t hesitate, buy the Neverstop. You won’t be sorry.",1 year ago
717,718,6401101,GagetGuy,5,Slick New Laser Printer,"This is one of HP's newest models of their Neverstop series. These models feature a new way to reload the toner. Rather than changing a complete cartridge, these models use a large syringe that is inserted into a special receptacle on the printer to quickly inject the toner into the existing cartridge/drum. It's supposed to be fast, easy, and reduce the carbon footprint on our landfills. ( I did not get to try that reload out yet.) And it can be done while the printer is actually printing which could be an advantage for busy offices where downtime is not practical. 
 
The printer comes packaged in cardboard with 2 end pieces of Styrofoam within the box. Pretty much standard. 

 Instructions to get the machine up and running are good and straightforward. It includes the power cord, a USB cable, cartridge already installed with a FULL supply of toner for up to 5000 pages included. One just has to remove some packing tape, open the machine and pull out an orange handle from the cartridge. Close the cover, plug it in and it turns itself on. 

 You then add the HP Smart App to your mobile device (both Android and Apple supported) and go through a simple set up for your WiFI in your house. The app sets the printer by Bluetooth to your WiFi settings. The app discovers your printer and you are set to print from your mobile device. It really is quick and easy. 
 
Once set up, you can print just about anything from your phone or tablet. I had a newer Win 10 HP laptop, and the HP Extra app was already loaded and ready to print wirelessly from that device. 

 I have found the machine can print from my Apple I Phone X quickly and easily. From the time the printer wakes up from a request to print to finished first page, just under 20 seconds!

The print looks great and it's very fast per page (21ppm per HP) The machine is relatively quiet while printing. After printing, the machine turns to standby in low power mode. 
 
Pros: Less landfill waste, quick refills that are supposed to be less costly, 5000 pages of printing right out of the box, can PRINT, COPY, & SCAN, 21 pages per minute output, wireless printing, HP App also allows for scanning/printing on your mobile device, and a small footprint on your desk from this printer. The copier function is straightforward and allows multiple copies as well as enlarge and reduction capabilities. I was also able to scan from the printer to my I phone using the HP app. Raise the scan cover and the machine wakes up, lay down the original and close. Use the HP app on your mobile device to scan the image on to your phone and it works. There is an option to Mobile Fax from this point, but I did not have that set up. 
 
Cons: No fax capabilities through landlines, Mobile Fax in App is a trial, HP print from anywhere is not supported. 

 Conclusion: I really like the size, speed, and ease this printer presents. WiFi connection seems stable and every time I have asked it to print Wirelessly it has performed with no glitches. The machine looks clean with sleek lines and is straightforward. I found it to be quiet and easy to operate. I think it would handle high volume printing needs with ease. Overall, its a winner! 

I would recommend this device to a friend!",1 year ago
718,719,6401101,DJSmooth,5,Amazing printer/copy machine—with a small caveat,"Overall— this is a beautiful office product. This is most definitely marketed to the small home business or small office environment as this model doesn’t include a feeder for a high volume business environment. It’s nonetheless a very aesthetically pleasing office product. The visual display window showing ink levels is a nice addition as other modern copiers require you to tap the screen and find those details under some setting window. It supports a number of features most offices would find helpful. A personal favorite is the scan from a phones camera. The resulting scan is quite good, almost as if it were scanned directly from the printers scan tray. I’ve attached an image of my scans, which I print out then use the scan feature.
But for the sake of transparency, some of the software features are available on a wide array of HP printers. They aren’t exclusive to this unit in particular.
Printing speed is quite fast, much faster than any typical consumer grade printer I’ve owned before. The quality of the prints (dpi) are excellent as well. From documents, to pictures, and abstract art while keeping in mind that it’s designed for document printing. 
However it does lack a bit of imagination for lack of a better word (more on that below). 

Pros:
Relatively easy setup. Pairing to a mobile phone/tablet Android or iOS is extremely straight forward and just works as long as you’re on the same network.
WiFi direct makes things far simpler as long as you are within the printers range. Just connect to its SSID using the pin it prints when you hold the “continue” key for 3 seconds.
Solid construction, it seems to be built for the long road ahead.
In my estimations, it appears that this unit runs at a much lower cost per use over other copy machines. Toner cartridges for other machines cost between $80-$120 and print roughly the same pages as these. A refill for the Neverstop runs around $20 and the drum hovers around $100. If the drum lasts more than 4 refill cycles then you’ve definitely got a lower cost per use out of it.
Many available features for different applications (image attached).
High quality prints for every type of file.
Beautifully lit up tactile buttons.

Cons:
Unlike pairing with a mobile device, pairing with a pc was a hassle. Others mentioned problems or unable to pair. In my case, the only way I could pair was using the WiFi direct option. Attempting to connect through the WiFi network would return an offline or unknown status from the printer. Once it paired one time using the WiFi direct setup I was able to connect using the WiFi network.
The paper trey is the only part I find in the construction that is questionable. The clips are flimsy and it just feels like the design was poor. The trey itself wiggles slightly to the touch. In my opinion it should of been a one piece design with the cover being the only part that was detachable. (See below for a picture of the design)
Lastly, at this price point I’m surprised it wasn’t considered to include a light up display. The only section on the display that lights up are the buttons. Everything else from the buttons to the toner level indicator light up. Makes printing in a dark room almost impossible.",1 year ago
719,720,6401101,mobilelawyer,5,Wireless Wonder,"This handsome, versatile HP Neverstop Printer went from out of the box into document production within minutes. It is a multi-function black and white laser printer and copier, and scans photographs and documents in color to save to the cloud, your local computer, or to immediately email to your selected recipients. Every function is performed quickly and efficiently though the HP Smart App. 

I was anxious to review this unit because of its potential cost savings on consumables. Most of my work printing is done in black and white from word processor documents and downloaded PDFs, and this HP easily cranks out crisp black and white pages to the tune of 21 per minute. Its toner cartridge boasts 5000 copies before it must be replenished. When it is time for replacement, you can order the kit straight from the Smart App. I like that feature, and very much look forward to the savings! HP promises big savings and simplicity of installation.

Scanning and copying is one page at a time. There is no document feeder, but if you are printing from a multiple page PDF or word processor document, you can select to print on both sides of the paper from the properties page of the app. Even though I made that selection, the document was not printed on both sides, and I could not get a different result using the windows system dialog. So, if two-sided printing is important to you, beware of that potential issue. 

Instructions were sparse. Supplied diagrams showed how to unpack and physically prepare the unit for first use. After turning on the machine, and letting it cycle through the set-up process, I used the add printer dialog on my Windows 10 laptop to find the printer on the network. It found the printer and informed me that an app was available for the device, and all I had to do to get it installed was click on a link. I installed the app from the Windows store and added the cloud print feature which allowed me to print documents from my Chromebook as well. The next time I fired up a different Windows 10 machine on my home network, a dialog box popped up and offered to download and install the HP Smart App on that machine. 

I was easily able to scan, save, print and email documents directly from the Smart App, which allows you to create commonly-used tasks, like emailing a scanned document to a specific person or persons or saving a document to the cloud, with click and go simplicity. The homepage of the app always shows the status of the toner, so that there will be no surprises when it is time to order the replenishment kit. 

I expect this HP to be a time and money saver for my black and white printing needs and was surprised to find it could scan documents in color as well, albeit without document feeding capabilities. And the HP Smart App was great to quickly save or send documents to others and perform repeated tasks.",1 year ago
720,721,6401101,momof2,5,Great Purchase,My sister and I had been searching for a new printer for awhile. We both purchased this item after lots of research. We wanted the black and white ink and compatibility to our Mac. Very happy with our purchase.,10 months ago
721,722,6401101,NinjaTard,5,"Affordable, Quality, and Smarter Than Me","I bought the Neverstopp Laser MFP 1202w because we don't print in color much and I've enjoyed my laser printers in the past. This one does printing, scanning, and copying which is fantastic but I feel that any printer for home use SHOULD do all those things anyway by default (that's just me perhaps). 

The big gimmick on this one is that it has a refillable toner slot on the front under the lid for the scanner, its intended to make refill easy, cheaper, and mess free. With the ""stay home, stay safe"" order we haven't printed much so I didn't even use half the cartridge that came in the box, although I can tell this will be a GREAT feature as the refill is currently less than a large pizza online and each fill should last 2500 pages. Much easier to manage than my old printer which needed almost triple digit expenses to refill.

Copy button works with a single press, which is fine, but the real cool thing to me was that it has a ""Copy ID"" button for if you have to turn in proof of your ID with paperwork. You place your ID, hit the button, it scans then flashes a ""continue"" button so you can open the lid, flip the ID, and once you press the continue button it prints both sides on the same sheet of paper. I tried to make a copy of a full color image and it came out readable but (obviously) black and white. The print speed is toted as being very fast at 21 pages per minute. I didn't time our print but I was able to print a 25 page packet for one child before I found and started the print for the 2nd child's packet of school work so if it's not as advertised its close enough. 

I was prepared to find my faults to complain about here when I attempted to setup WiFi printing, I have never been able to get it to work with my old printers. Once more I was impressed at HP's new offering as it simply asked permission to access the network I was already connected to and then set itself up! I literally printed a handful of coloring pages to test that it was actually working and wasn't just a fluke! Skeptical despite the evidence I downloaded the HP Smart app on my android and again the setup was more or less automated and then I was able to print emails and pictures from my phone! The only thing, and it may have been user error, was that I turned on airplane mode while at work and after I got home I had trouble getting it working again but it did end up reconnecting after a few trials and errors.

Overall I think I'll be quite happy with this all in one printer, its small enough to not take up my entire desk corner while having enough single press ease to not annoy me. The WiFi setup which usually becomes a chore/headache was done before I could realize I didn't need to be annoyed. All the things I have printed look good and the copy features are impressive. Admittedly I'm not super picky or demanding of my printer since we just use it for family paperwork and homework but nothing we've thrown at this thing has been bad! Highly recommend for printing on a budget.",1 year ago
722,723,6401101,kwebbster,5,Very Good Home or Small Office Laser Printer,"Having used an inkjet for a lot of our smaller jobs, or a laser printer behemoth that is shared amongst several offices, we decided we needed something with a little better print quality for our smaller print jobs. This printer is a small square piece of equipment that doesn't take up too much table space. Unlike a lot of HP printers, there isn't a super cool LED panel, just a simple readout that shows status. We unboxed the printer with no issues, and there was a LOT of shipping tape to be removed. We were somewhat disconcerted when it came to opening the lid to remove a shipping piece. The lid opens just so far, then kind of stops. We looked at it for a little while before deciding to go ahead and add a little more force to open it. That was the trick, even though I was sure that it was going to break. But it doesn't, I guess that's the way its supposed to be. While open, we saw the toner refill port which we haven't used yet (the printer comes with enough toner for 5000 sheets it says), but looking forward to. It seems really straight forward though. Getting the printer set up with our MacBooks was really simple and the HP app got everything up and running. The print quality is very good and paper handling is good for such a small printer. Unfortunately, no duplex (2-sided) printing here. The print was concise with no smearing or dropouts. Also, this printer has the added bonus of a scanner built on top of the printer which will help take some pressure (or time) from the shared office printer. So all in all, this seems to be a very good home or small office printer. There is no fax, but Im not sure how many people need this capability anymore. Looking forward to see how easy and cheap the toner refills are going to be. Good Shopping!",1 year ago
723,724,6401101,MigDigital,3,Compact & Fast printing experience w/downside,"Review based onL: 1.Out of box setup in mobile and desktop 2.Ease to print 3.Print quality
The printer physically blend well to home furniture setting due to its compact hardware form,.
From out of box, setting is easy while using mobile phone (used iPhone). 
Ease to print from mobile phone as select printer, immediately printing starts without any delay or other steps between selection of document and action print. 
Print quality is good although sound bit obvious considering is laser printing.

However, to take advantage of it fully, need to be used with HP own application “HP Smart” which is same for mobile and desktop. It allow to perform multiple options and control from setup to edit scanned document, print options and create routinery actions via Smart Tasks to create rules. 

HP require this application to connect the printer to the network. Then the application is quite handy to use during mobile phone experience to avoid having to use multiple applications for photos and scan activities. 

What didn’t work well from out of box experience:
1. Print via desktop. Using HP Smart from desktop doesn’t recognize the printer. It consistently shows Offline And this is even though added the printer and connected to network via desktop. Hence it recognize to add, but cannot perform any action via HP Smart. On the other hand, even trying to print without HP Smart, the desktop find it off line. However, using OS native Scan program “Capture” for MacOS, printer is found to scan. 
2. Hardware itself is bit considerably noisy when it turn on, or start printing. Then, it turns to sleep mode, or activate to print, at least noticed under this conditions, it does a click alike noise. Click noise like when plug ethernet port. This is bit annoying for case as I used next to my desk.
3. Setting it up is not strategy forward or at least in first time attempt from out of box.If account created in mobile for HP Smart, then logging in the same application in the desktop, it doesn’t show automatically the printer. Need to perform again the setup to add printer. The same effect by logging in in the online account for which it ask for claim code from printer that is now where to find despite following multiple instructions. 
4. It seems HP attempt add services via Web Services and Mobile Fax. However, it is not straight to setup WbServices. Mobile Fax is easy to setup, but HP doesn’t provide if there is any fee or rate associated unless user diggn about it in the internet. 
5. Paper trail and its cover is bit hassle to place accordingly.
6. Control buttons feels flimsy. Black cover feels would peel off at anytime after some usage. Screens small and hard read or understand icons at first sight.

Attached picture of control, paper tray cover detached, placement, opened for scanning.

In short, application and services with the hardware doesn’t seem to be well integrated or fully prepared. But works well for the basic printing need.

If it is only about printing works fine. But considering all the addition around it makes the printer average for MSPR price point. And doesn’t offer any exceptional aspect that would distinguish from other brands. Of course, this model strongest feature point is 5000 pages with single cartridges as per HP specification. But user need to go through the negative experience to take advantage of it.",1 year ago

725,726,6401101,Gerbil,3,"Low on features, toner tank has potential","The HP Neverstop Laser MFP 1202w is part of a new line of printers implementing refillable toner tanks rather than using replaceable toner cartridges; this could be a significant boon to small offices. HP makes a bold savings claims which they’ll have to at least partially live up to in order to offset the price of the unit relative to its limited feature set.

[ Toner tank ]

The tank storage concept has been around a while for inkjet printers, but this is a first (as far as I can tell) for laser printers. The toner tank holds a little over two refill kits worth of toner, which grants great flexibility in deciding when to refill the tank without having to consider toner waste. Normally you’d use a cartridge until it runs out, which is usually discovered in the middle of a ruined print job which requires you to stop what you’re doing to replace the cartridge, but with a refillable tank, that scenario can be avoided. Gone will be the days of taking out the cartridge, giving it a good shake to loosen clumps stuck in the corners, and re-inserting it for the sake of saving some coin only to have to replace it shortly afterwards (after one or more further bad print jobs). If this all works as advertised, this could be a significant boon for small office environments. Unfortunately, I can’t confirm the advertised savings. The HP store website lists zero replacement products available for this printer and can’t find the replacement toner by its model number. The HP Smart app’s ‘Get Supplies’ feature was of no help. This is a common handicap for early reviewers. Noteworthy is that the advertised savings are for toner only, so image drum life and replacement costs should be considered as well in comparing maintenance costs once the information becomes available.

[ Physical design ]

+ A three-segment toner level indicator remains lit on the front of the printer to aid in toner management.
- The flimsy, loose, low-capacity snap-in paper input tray with its sketchy paper guides and protuberant placement is terribly disappointing. I’ve had a family member accidentally bump the tray on a similar HP printer causing it to snap off and break in two; I imagine the same could very easily happen with this printer. It would be so much saner to have a proper slide-in tray that docks flush with the front face of the printer, which is the norm for this form factor.
- When the interface buttons are individually ‘active’, they are lit and very clearly identifiable. However, when not active/lit they are difficult or impossible to identify in moderate or worse lighting. The LCD display is similarly problematic as it’s not back-lit.

[ Features ]

This printer is quite slim on features for its price point. Missing features that you can find on other comparable printers include:
- Color (laser) printing
- Duplex printing and scanning with automatic document feeder
- Flush-mounted paper input tray with higher capacity, sometimes with an extra multi-purpose input tray
- Native fax support
- Ethernet port for more stable or redundant connectivity
- Back-lit color touchscreen display
- Faster printing and higher duty cycle ratings

Notable features this printer does have:
+ The toner tank which currently appears to be a unique feature
+ Direct WiFi printing (bypassing the need for an intermediary access point)
+ Ability to set up the printer via a mobile app
+ The HP Smart app has an interesting ‘camera scan’ option which grabs an image from the camera or a file and performs automatic text selection and geometric transformation to optimize for printing, useful for reproducing text on an object that won’t fit on the flatbed scanner.
+ Support for Google Cloud Print (hidden behind the web interface which can be accessed directly, or via the HP Smart app).

[ Setup & operation ]

The documentation is scarce and insufficient, and the setup process could be smoother. The included Reference Guide has a section for setting up WiFi using WPS as well as using WiFi Direct, but not for setting up normal WiFi without WPS. I first connected via WiFi Direct for testing which worked fine. I installed the HP Smart app assuming it would guide me through setting up a normal WiFi connection, which I wanted to try next. Surprisingly, the app didn’t show any detected printer, and further suggested that I should have already connected the printer via WiFi, seemingly missing an important step. Checking back with the Reference Guide, I found the critical missing information in the wireless troubleshooting section: if the wireless light/button is not lit (which it wasn’t by default), you must press the button to turn on “wireless connection mode” (not direct). After adding the printer to my WiFi network, the app detected the printer and could fully utilize it. On three different desktop computers running Windows 10, I had three different setup experiences. On one, the printer was detected and added automatically (which I wasn’t expecting). On the second, I had to click on ‘Add a printer’ under the ‘Devices and Printers’ Control Panel app, which easily found the printer and added it successfully (this is the process I expected). On the third computer, I did the same as for the second computer, but for some reason I failed to grasp, it initiated the WiFi Direct setup process which caused a PIN page to be printed. After cancelling the setup process and trying again (without doing anything differently), it proceeded with the normal WiFi configuration (not direct) which succeeded. In all cases, all three computers (after setup) were able to print to and scan from the printer without requiring additional software. I tested both the mobile and Windows versions of the HP Smart app, as well as the print and scan “accessories” (native applications, whereas HP Smart is a UWP app) available on the product support page, which all functioned well for me without any unexpected problems.

Printing is somewhat loud for a laser printer of this form factor, but not overly so. Printed standard black text looks very crisp and clean. However, the printing of solid/uniform grey in text and images is rather poor, with very noticeable and inconsistent horizontal banding and random localized artifacting. Gradients are likewise prone to artifacts.

[ Conclusion ]

The Neverstop printer series by HP is one to watch, as the toner tank design could be a game-changer. While this technology has merits beyond potential cost savings, these savings *are* the primary advertising point for this printer. This is especially important considering the primary cost of using a printer is not the up-front purchase price, but rather the cumulative cost of replenishing consumables over the printer’s lifetime. With consumable pricing information not yet available, the true value of this printer remains dubious. With over-all quality that is not so great and lacking features for its price point, I currently wouldn’t recommend this printer to others. If the replacement toner is revealed to enable significant cost savings, then I’d switch to recommending this printer for satisfying casual printing and scanning needs.",1 year ago
726,727,6401101,JMan,5,"Small footprint, solid performance","The overall size and footprint of this HP is fairly compact and doesn’t require a lot of space. It’s comparable to a medium-sized home inkjet printer. The scanning bed is raised and sits above the paper return bin. The paper source bin is located on the bottom front. Rather than removable trays, the paper slides into a single 150 sheet capacity paper bin and a plastic cover snaps over it to hide the paper completely. It looks like a protruding paper tray but it isn’t. The power cord is approximately 5-feet long which is a bit short. I had to raid my computer parts for a longer cord so it could reach the power outlet on the other side of the desk. The hardware setup was relatively simple despite a pretty bad setup guide. Even calling the guide marginally helpful is a stretch. It contains very little useful information that didn’t answer several setup issues that I ran into. Even the pictographs were incorrect. The illustrations show the scanning bed tilted back at a 70-degree angle. In reality, it tilts back no farther than 10-degrees at most. If someone attempts to force it back as far as depicted in the illustration, they’ll likely damage it.

Connectivity options include wifi, wifi direct or USB (type A) connectivity. I prefer wifi, so that’s how I configured it out of the box. The printer has no touchscreen or hardware buttons that can be used to configure wifi. The monochrome LCD screen is basic and printer management tasks are performed through the HP Smart app. The printer can also be managed through a web browser interface after it’s connected to wifi. I installed the HP Smart app on my smartphone and tablet and ran into the same problem on both. I could connect to the printer fine via wifi direct but the printer would not connect to my home wifi. I’d enter the wifi setup screen, select my SSID, enter my password and hit connect. The app would indicate the printer was connecting to wifi but a few moments later would display an error stating it could not connect. I verified that my router and wifi settings were compatible and kept repeatedly trying to connect for a solid half-hour. Just as I was just about to give up and connect using the included USB cable, the printer finally connected to my home wifi through the app on one final attempt. 

The printer has worked pretty well after I finally got it functional. I added it to a Windows 10 PC and allowed the OS to install the drivers automatically. Not only did it install the drivers but it installed the Windows version of the HP Smart app as well. The illuminated toner level indicator on the front of the printer is useful and provides an instant and easily viewable toner status. Toner and printer status can also be monitored through the app. I included a photo of the LCD screen and button panel. A four-page multi-language reference guide is included to aid with deciphering the buttons and indicator lights. All other guides, including the user guide, can be downloaded from the printer’s support page on HP’s site. Despite my early connection woes, wifi connectivity has been rock-solid since it finally connected that first time.

Print quality is very good and even better than some of the expensive high volume business class laser printers that I use daily. Text and grid lines are crisp and clean with no jaggies or other artifacts. Print speed is sufficiently fast. Graphics quality depends on the content being printed. Monochrome charts, diagrams and images look very nice and on most occasions are identical to the source material. Colorful photographs and heavily detailed color graphics tend to look a little worse due to the limitations of printing in monochrome. It doesn’t matter whether it’s this consumer grade monochrome MFP or a $5,000 business class MFP. That type content is best printed on a color laser or inkjet printer because only so much detail can be reliably reproduced in monochrome. Noise levels during printing are moderate and never reach the point of being annoying or disruptive. The printer does not generate any noticeable heat in the surrounding environment during heavy printing. 

Scan quality is also pretty good. Text, graphics and photos are clear, sharp and good for everyday use. Scanning can be performed through the HP app or a computer’s native scanning app. The scan resolution is adjustable from 200dpi to 300dpi in the phone/tablet app and 75dpi to 600dpi in the desktop app. It also has a card copy/scan feature. Scans can be exported to PDF, JPF, TIFF, PNG and RAW formats. There is no automatic document feeder, so all scanning and copying must be done individually from the scanning glass. 

I haven’t owned this HP long enough to rate long-term durability or how frequently it cycles through consumables. Toner replenishment seems very simple and cost effective when compared to traditional toner cartridges. I am eager to try the new HP toner refill kits. If they are reliable, inexpensive and as easy to use as they seem, they could potentially be a true game changer. It would finally offer an affordable inkjet for everyone. The printers themselves are usually affordable but the price of supplies typically end up costing way more than the device in the long run. Replacing all four toner cartridges at once in my small office HP color LaserJet costs $100 more than the price of the printer. That’s just a one time full replacement, not a cumulative total. That’s also absurd.

This HP 1202w is a good performing multifunction. It doesn’t really have any fancy bells and whistles or sought-after extra features. Even the “duplexing” is manual. It is, however, quite capable at what it does. That is print, scan and copy very well, although it doesn’t have fax capability. The lack of fax capability and an ADF isn’t a big deal for personal use or a home office but could potentially be an issue for business users, especially in busy offices. Who wants to manually copy a 20-30 page document one sheet at a time? For those who can survive without an ADF or fax capability, it’s hard to go wrong with this choice. The prospect of super-quick inexpensive toner replenishment makes it that much more enticing.",1 year ago
727,728,6401101,ViperElectric,5,"Easy Setup, and it just works.","I'll start with the good items, the first thing is this printer is super simple to set up. All you have to do is install an HP app on your phone and follow the instructions to add a printer. This makes it simple and quick to connect the printer to your home wifi so it can be used by all of your devices. Connecting the printer to your windows 10 computer after it has been set up is even easier as all I had to do was go to ""add printer"", find the device in the list (since its already on my network) and click add. Windows even prompts you to install the HP app after its done installing the printer so that you can use all of the printer's features like scanning as well.

The HP smart app is simple and easy to use both on your PC and on your phone. It has to be one of the easiest to use print apps for a mobile device I have used in a long time. 

Print quality is what I expect from a laser printer super quick and clean sharp prints. Even a full page of black printed well without an excess of dark or light spots. Text prints very clean and I have had no issue with paper feed or operation at all. 

Scanning items to my computer was also super easy with the HP smart app on windows, just open the app press the button for scanning place the item on the scanner and start it. Once it's scanned the app allows you to save the scan as either a PDF or a JPG, verify simple and quick. It will make quick work of scanning in paperwork for work. 

The user interface on the printer is very minimal but I like that. I never saw the need for big graphical displays on a printer, I just need the thing to copy and print and this printer does that well with the controls given. 

I also like the small footprint of the printer, it takes up very little space.

Now for probably the only thing I am not a huge fan of, the paper tray. I know it might sound odd to call out a paper tray on a printer but I would have rather had a nice pull out drawer to put the paper in instead of the way it is handled with this printer. The odd paper cover that is provided instead is just strange. It feels like it was kind of an afterthought when they realized they needed to have a way to cover the paper slot that they provide. 

I also wish you could fit a few more sheets of paper in the paper slot but that is more of a personal preference I guess. 

Overall this printer works great and the one shortcoming of the way paper is handled is not enough for me to not like the printer as a whole. It prints quickly, print quality is good, and setup was the easiest I've had with a wifi printer in a long time.",1 year ago

733,734,6473920,DotNetJon,4,Great Little Pocket Printer,"I've been playing with this little printer for a few days, and am pretty impressed with it. It uses no ink, but instead uses thermal paper, which allows for it's super small size. The battery powered and Bluetooth capabilities make it a breeze to take with you! The battery lasts for a reasonable amount of time, but could be better. Just printing about 8 pictures over the course of a few days, it went from fully charged to around 20%. Some of that is most likely idle time, as I did not manually shut it off in-between uses. I have it set to turn itself off after an hour and sleep after Sleep after 5 minutes. Still, not too shabby for it's small size.

The HP Sprocket software that you download and use to connect to the printer is really quite well done, and very easy to use. Even if you don't have a Sprocket printer, it would make a nice image editing tool for your phone. It connectes to Instagram, Facebook, Google, and your local images on your phone or tablet. Really makes it easy to make prints of your online photos.

The size of the prints limits their use, obviously. Not something you'll be printing any detail with, but for fun-sized photos for sharing with friends, it's great. The paper has peel off backs that allow you to make stickers out of the little photos. This would make a great gift for a kid or scrapbook keeper.

The HP Sprocket app lets you crop, adjust color settings, add borders, text, little fun graphics you can add on top of the photo, and overlays. You can use these features to edit your photos, then print out on a larger printer or share to one of your social media sites.

My colleague was able to download the Sprocket software and connect to my printer. It's supposed to support up to 3 additional connections, although I only tried myself and one other.

You can change the color of the little LED on the front to whatever color you like, which is a nice little personalization feature. 

The printer takes about 45 seconds from the time you press print to print an image, so the speed isn't great if you are wanting to print several photos to distribute. 

The software has a Photo booth mode which takes 4 timed pictures and combines them into one image. This is fun for taking pictures with friends.

The printer itself is really light, but feels well made. Changing the paper is easy. Just pop off the top and insert into the tray. It comes with a pack of 10 papers, including a calibration sheet. They recommend not putting any more paper than this to avoid jams.",3 years ago
734,735,6473920,RedScorpion,4,Fun and Getting Better,"The HP Sprocket 2nd Edition uses no ink and instead heats ZINK paper to reveal the photo in a single pass. It’s fun. The pictures are cute and you can stick them to anything. 

I feel like this printer is a Polaroid for the digital age. Everyone has a phone and this printer produces instant prints for far less money than a Polaroid or an inkjet.

Multiple devices can hook up to the printer at the same time. At one point I had a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, an iPhone, and an iPad hooked up. The apps work virtually the same regardless of device and connection was simple.

But, I was expecting a bit more from a 2nd Edition. The prints look good, but they aren’t great. It won’t replace a good inkjet for overall printer quality. I noticed banding in skies or solid colors and sometimes flesh tones would get overblown or washed out.

The big new feature with the second edition is the AR. You can now print from a video clip or put an animated frame and when you scan the picture with the app, the picture will come to life and even play a video clip. The AR feature worked well on my iPhones and even displayed location information and google street information for the pictures. You can decide if you want information embedded in the print or not.

The AR prints were, again, fun. But, some AR features were limited by which device I used to view the photo. For instance, I could create a picture with an embedded video on my phone and view the video with my phone, but if I tried to view that same video on another phone, it wouldn’t work. It would still show location data and any photos related to that location, but I couldn’t watch the picture come to life with the embedded video clip. This makes sense as it is pulling the file from my original device and not a cloud service. But, I wish it was a universal feature... Now, the animated borders and stickers will work on any phone with the app. 

However, I couldn’t get the AR features to work on my tablets. My Samsung Galaxy crashed whenever I tried to view any AR details and the iPad didn’t fare much better. It just never could reveal anything. Now, I could view the embedded location information printed from my tablets on my iPhone, but the opposite didn’t work. I know all devices had the AR features turned on.

Battery life is okay, but if you are using this at a party or group function, I would have it plugged in. After 5 - 6 photos, my battery would be down to the final bar. On that note, the charging cable is too short. I think it is only a foot and a half.

It appears that HP is adding more features and functions to the app and the printer at all times. So, I am hopeful that there will be more AR borders and stickers in the future as the current selection is rather slim.

Also, I would like it if we could get a PC driver at some point. I don’t see why laptops or surface devices can’t join the party. 

So, would I recommend the Sprocket? Sure. I am having a lot of fun with it. I don’t know if the new features are enough to warrant an upgrade for original Sprocket owners, but at $5 - $10 for a pack of 20 prints, I think this is a great pick-up. I look forward to getting a travel case and a small photo booklet.",3 years ago

736,737,6473920,Drummer7,4,Cute and efficient,"I’ve been wanting to print some of our travel pictures so I could pin it on a map, frame it and hang it on a wall... And this palm size printer made it so easy and quick for me!

It’s pretty easy to set up. When I opened the box did not see any instructions, but once you download and open the app, it will guide you through it. The app is super user friendly and really straight forward to use. And you connect the printer with your phone via Bluetooth. 

With the app you can edit and customize your pictures with frames, stickers, or other decorations, then hit ""print"" and in seconds out comes your photo! The ink is in the paper so there is no need for ink cartridges.

The cool feature is that you can print pictures from your Instagram, Facebook and Google! All you have to do is login into your account and select the picture you want to print! Simple and easy! 

I like to do some editing on my pictures and with this app you CAN print photos that have been previously edited using your phone or other picture editing apps! And the colors look true to me.

You can take pictures using the app too, even selfies and it will print it right away. But since I like to do some editing this feature didn’t really interested me.

So overall, if you are looking for a small printer, and you just want some fun little 2x3s pictures for your projects, look no more. This IS the one to get!",3 years ago
737,738,6473920,Snet,1,"Quality so bad, I must have gotten a lemon","I picked this up today from BestBuy. I honestly was not expecting a true picture quality resoultion or color; I just want a decent sticker quality for my diary. 

However I was shocked that the quality was so bad — like the color picture in an old newspaper front page with multiple horizontal and verical streaks. Another huge problem was that the true white and yellow printed extreme PINK. Picture seems all blown up. (i tried printing all kinds of pictures with different colors and resolutions). I tried printing black&white picture, but picture came out with partial red. 

I looked at different youtube reviews on this device and the pictures that got printed by other owners actually seem pretty good. So maybe, I thought my zinc photo paper was bad, so I opened a brand new zinc photo pack and I still have the same issue. Yes, I did the blue paper face down first just like HP told me to do in their homepage community threads with people complaining of red (pink) hue problems. I did all the resets too but no luck. Yes my battery green and was charged nearly full. So I must have gotten a lemon, which means HP needs some serious quality control. 

I am going back to the store to buy another same model since I am convinced i got a lemon. Everyone seems to say good things on their reviews. HP’s proper quality control could have prevented my inconvenience and unnecessary car gasoline and mileage.",2 years ago
738,739,6473920,joecaffe,5,"Instant prints, no wires!","This is a nice little printer that helps make your social media posts physical. The app is fairly intuitive and has some decent customization options. If you don't see an enhancement in the list, the app allows you to make your own and save it, cool feature! I took it to a recent party and the guests were wowed at how quickly I customized and printed stickable keepsakes for them! The printer is very portable and the pictures show good detail and color reproduction for such a small print and no ink cartridges.
The only issue I had was with the embedded experiences and getting it to work. Once configured in the app, the printer makes photos with an invisible watermark that, when scanned with the reveal camera, should show an AR experience on your phone. I followed the instructions and even used a still frame from a video I took of a new car event (see photo) but the app said ""no reveal content found"". That being said, it's a gee wiz feature that does nothing to the usefulness and functionality of this party printer!",2 years ago
739,740,6473920,Kris1973,4,Incredibly fun little sticker printer.,"Starting with the positives: This little printer is incredibly easy to set up and fun to use. Within fifteen minutes of opening the box, I had printed through the 10-pack of Zink paper included with the printer, testing out everything from printing selfies to greenery and even some graphic art, which brings me to one of the most enjoyable things about the HP Zinc paper: It’s self-adhesive. Printing out little 2x3 stickers with your pictures or little sayings is a lot of fun! While quite small for a photo print at 2” by 3”, the pictures do print completely edge-to-edge so there’s no wasted space. 2x3 is small for a print, but seems oddly appropriate for a sticker. 

The built-in battery lasts through about one pack of ten prints before needing a recharge and the prints come out quickly with a satisfying little hum. It reminds me of taking Polaroid pictures back in the “old” days.

On the down side, the colors in the prints can be (but aren’t always) somewhat washed out - particularly skin tones, though at least the resolution is fine enough that the prints don’t end up looking grainy. I think the Zink paper still has a little trouble with vibrant reds, which is why I dropped my review down to 4 stars.

So, if you’re looking for a fun little battery powered portable printer that can print out 2x3 stickers for you and your friends (or kids), this is it. Because the “ink” is in the paper, the refill packs of paper can be somewhat pricey but Best Buy was running a sale on refills so I stocked up on a few packs while the price was more attractive.",3 years ago

741,742,6473920,Hinata,4,very fun and versatile,"I really wanted one, and i was eyeing on a different product. However I was lucky to get this one on sale. I'm not much of a HP user, but I do like their products that come out. Sometimes they are unresponsive however if you have patience to be able to fix the simplest things yourself, basically just restarting it, then it works fine. 

This sprocket itself is one of them. I have to sometimes restart the app in order for the pictures I just took to work (to show in the selection). I read the reviews and i can see why people say they see the red hue on the skintone. But after following the directions of the HP Support, it looks fine.

As you can see, starting from the left, I tried one in black & white, it came out a tint of blue. 2nd one I tried the wand that the HP Support recommended to do, it look animated. And the 3rd one is without and it looked fine. The other 3 I did i used the wand and thy came out amazing.

I hope they come out with more borders and stickers in the app for the sprocket, I like playing with those. I do recommend people to give it a shot, at least this product.",1 year ago
742,743,6473920,Gus321,5,Absolutely Love This!,This is exactly what I was looking for. You have so many different printing options using the accompanying app. I print pictures to add to my planner and journal. It is very simple to use.,1 year ago
743,744,6473920,Danno,4,Fun and Quick!,"If you’re on the go and looking for a fun way to print photos, then this is it. After charging the unit for about an hour it was ready to use. It can connect to your smart device via Bluetooth. Download the app and you’re able to print pocket-sized photos. Printing a photo is a quick and easy process. Open the app, select the photo you want to print and press the printer button. In a matter of 15 seconds, it’s printed.

The quality isn’t as nice as a larger printer, but it’s not shabby for something that fits in the palm of my hand.

The app also allows you to make edits and add fun little things to the photo. It was pretty cool to print a photo I had just posted to my social media.

I brought it to a friend’s house and it was a hit. Everyone loved trying it out and wanted to use it. People loved the idea of being able to snap a photo and quickly print it for a keepsake.

My wife is excited about using this because she thinks it’ll be a great resource for adding photos to the “baby book” for our child. I admit, it’ll be pretty cool.

Takeaway:
Because of the size, I wonder how many photos will print before I have to purchase ink. Also, having to purchase the photo paper is a drag, but not a deal breaker. I like the idea of being able to print things quickly from my phone.

Try not to mind the qality of the photo, it was tough trying to focus on both the phone and printed image.",1 year ago

And by far this is the best Epson printer I have owned - the smaller size and speed is superior to other models. And that includes Canons and Brothers I have owned. Some of the printers I have had in the past are R2D2 sized beasts for the amount of work I've needed them to do. But this one, very small size with a great scanner, copy function and printing that rivals even laser printers. And I tested it - takes print commands from 50+ feet away (not that I need to do that often). I would have given it five stars if the set-up instructions were a teensy bit easier to deal with.

We were tired of paying the costly price of printer ink. The EcoTank Pro ET-5170 printer was the answer to all of our printing needs.
   This printer can print forever without having to replace the ink cartages every week or month and saves us a lot of money. The capacity of the paper tray is also quite large it can hold 250 sheets of paper. I love to print my own photos for my business and personal photos as well. The photos that this printer can produce are amazing. This printer also has the ability to create double sided prints to save us even more money on paper.

  This is not just a printer it is also a scanner, fax machine and copy machine. My husband and I share an office so it does not take up a lot of space and replaces three devices. I have to scan lots of documents for my businesses and scanner in this device scans multiple documents automatically saving me time.

776,777,6459602,Jarka1,5,Great All in one Printer,"Great Super tank printer
I got this EcoTank Pro ET-5170 for my Home business office. My first impression is wow, It's great All in one printer. Let's start with set up. On the box you have printed instructions how to unbox your printer, Very easy. It was securely taped with blue tape for transport. You need to check everywhere for the tapes and remove them. Warranty card ,set up instruction and software CD is included too. .Filling ink tanks is very easy too. Just remove the bottle cap and insert to filling port until it stop flowing, close the cap and repeat with another color. Next step load paper into loading cassette. Install software ,connect to WI-FI and you are good to go. Whole process is very self explanatory and easy. 
 I did install Epson Smart Panel App on my Android phone and I can now print photos from my phone. Quality and speed of the printing is amazing.  
You can choose gloss or matte photo, plain paper, envelopes etc. It does double sided prints too which is great help.  
The cartridges should apparently be good for 2 years .but of course it vary how much you will use it. It's great All in One printer .

777,778,6459602,dylanbuk,5,Well Worth the Cost,"The Epson EcoTank Pro ET-5170 printer is a nifty mid-size dual level printer, scanner, and fax machine. The big feature on this great for work at home workers and small business owners printer is its EcoTank ink system. While at first I was apprehensive that I would make a mess filling up the ink such fears went away after I added the first color and discovered  how quick and easy and safeguarded the process is. 

The other fear I had was around the set up of the printer – both the physical and network setup would be difficult, but nothing could be further from reality. The printer comes completely intact in the box. Just pull it out and plug it in and your printer is set up. Adding the printer to your wifi network and getting out up and running was also super simple with prompts to guide you along the way. The same goes for the app which is where you’ll be doing much of your printing. I just wish the app had a better user interface since I found it a bit clunky.  

Now on the main event – how it works. For a home printer you will be hard pressed to find a better printer, especially when it comes to quality and speed. This thing produces high quality prints – whether it be regular print jobs, double sided jobs, labels, photos, ID cards – crisply and quickly. The scanner and copier functionalities also were great whether it was a single page or several. 
Overall, this is printer is sturdy, attractive, and works great. If you do a lot of printing at home, this is the printer to get. And the money you’ll save with the EcoTank makes it well worth the price. Another great product from Epson.

779,780,6459602,SmRo,4,Quick and Compact Color Printing Dream,"First impressions upon receiving the Epson EcoTank ET-5170 Wireless Printer was the compact design. Not only was the printer smaller than I expected, around 14.8"" x 13.7"" x 13.6"", but it was also very light (under 20 lbs).  Unboxing was a breeze.  The box contained the printer, an AC power cable, 2 rather generous black ink bottles (127 ml each), and one each of cyan, magenta, and yellow color bottles (each 70 ml).  There was also a quick guide for set up as well as a CD -Rom that could be used for computer setup.
The Epson EcoTank ET-5170 quick guide for setup was very user friendly.  The first step was to remove the blue tape that kept the printer safe during shipping. Filling the EcoTank ink was next.  I was very pleased with the efficiency and cleanliness in doing this.  Each bottle is fitted with a nozzle that directly fits to the accompanying tank.  The black tank took about 90 seconds to fill and the color around 30 seconds each.  Once filled, the ink did seem to settle, so I reattached the bottles allowing the small remaining ink to be dispersed. There was zero squeezing, no leaks, spills, or wasted ink at the end of the process. This was fantastic!
Next, I attached the 5 foot AC power cable and powered on the printer.  There is a 2.4” touchscreen monitor that walks you through the options for time and date formatting. The next prompt begins an eleven minute ink charge. This was a great time for me to upload the Epson Smart Panel app to my phone.  The Epson EcoTank ET-5170 has the option to be connected  wirelessly or by USB or ethernet cable (not included with the printer). After the ink is charged, the printer guides you through a series of print tests that create the perfect alignments and adjustments. Once that is complete, the printer prompts through Wi Fi connection, as well as a Quick Fax Set-up Wizard, if that is an option you would like to use.
Paper is loaded via a drop down door in the front of the printer.  The paper drawer has the expected paper guides to help with correct positioning when loading paper of different sizes.  Printing was clean and crisp and the paper came out with the printed side face down.  The top of the EcoTank ET-5170 also comes equipped with a top loading copier and a flatbed scanner.  The scanner works as expected but with a slightly less crisp resolution than the actual printer. The toploading copier was the only disappointment for me and the only reason I would not give a perfect 5 star review. The paper to be copied had to be placed just right or it would not advance.  It took me several tries to get this to function and even then, it was not perfect.  It almost felt like tension was too tight in the rollers and was hindering the paper from advancing correctly.  
Overall I think the Epson EcoTank ET-5170 Wireless Printer is a great option for small offices, at home work spaces, and for families who aggressively use color ink.  This price point of the printer may be a little more than one may want to spend on an at home printer, but the savings on ink will make up the difference.

781,782,6347467,MG30,5,IT'S NOT ONLY A PRINTER!,"A few days ago I received this printer ALL IN ONE! not only print, also copies, scan and it works as a fax! Is not that amazing? if that were not enough, do not use cartridges or cables to configure it!

I was thrilled when I saw the new technology applied in this device, because a few years ago in my country (Venezuela) many people used to alter the design of their printer to put an ink system similar to it in order to save on cartridges.

As for my personal experience, I confess that at first I got a little nervous when I was going to fill the tank with the ink, I thought it would make a mess, but no! designed the anti spill device, excellent for that! you only have to lift the lid and place the corresponding bottle in each color and VOILA!

The printer has a small color touch screen for its configuration, very easy to use, that process only took 15 minutes while the printer was calibrated ... obviously I was excited to make the first trial impression to see its quality, without a doubt some I liked to be an ink printer, I have previously used others to mark and I noticed that the pigment grain of the EPSON is much better.

Attached you can see the full color print that I made from my smartphone! both devices are easily linked and only use the internet of my cell phone.

Another PLUS that has this device is that you can see the level of ink, conventional printers with ink cartridges can not see that and it is very frustrating when you are printing and the process stops when you have to replace the cartridge.",2 years ago

784,785,6347467,Jodijode,4,Great all-in-one & love the refillable ink tanks!,"As someone who has used Epson products for years, I was excited when Epson came out with the EcoTank series.  Not only do I like all the features but what really interested me was the ability to refill your own tanks!

For the initial setup, the ET-4760 was fairly easy to set up using the quick start instructions as well as easy to follow on-screen instructions. I was worried that filling the tanks myself would be a messy complicated process but I couldn't have been more wrong!  The tanks filled very easily & I had absolutely no mess.  The only issue I had was when adding the final bit of ink after charging the tanks, I had to play with the bottles a bit because the ink initially didn't want to drain into the tanks.   The printer no longer comes with disks that include the necessary software but you can easily find it on the Epson website.  The software & drivers installed with no problems.

As far as the actual performance, I had no problems printing right off the bat via my wi-fi connection.  I printed regular text, documents & photos & all printed with the usual Epson quality that I've come to know over the years.  It is quite a bit louder than the other Epson printers I've had in the past, though.  This printer offers the option to select speed or quality which can be a great ink saver when you don't need something printed with a high DPI.    I do wish the paper tray was a bit more sturdy.  It seems like it could easily break if it should get bumped.  One thing I was disappointed with was the scanner.  The ADF seemed a little finicky.  Sometimes it would grab the paper crooked & jam & even after clearing the jam, I would have to re-start the printer to get the ADF to work again.  Once I was actually able to scan, if I scanned from the computer it would scan fine but for the life of me I could not get the Scan to Computer feature to work.  I very often scan photos documents from my scanner to the computer ( I also have an Artisan 837) so I'm very familiar with this feature.  No matter what I did, I could not get it to work.  I rebooted my computer, the printer, my modem & my router.  I also re-installed the software & nothing worked.  I still haven't been able to get it to work.  It never recognizes my computer for some reason but yet if I go into the Epson Scan 2 software or Adobe Photoshop, the scanner is there.  I have dual 2G/5G internet connection but the printer only recognizes the 2G connection.  My next step is to change my computer from 5G to 2G to see if they both have to be on the same connection for that feature to work.  The printer does also offer the fax feature but I haven't had a chance to test that out. 

Overall, I really do like this printer & would recommend it because of all the great features, including the refillable tanks.  Not only can the tanks last up to 2 years but I think being able to refill them yourself can save you money in the long run.

786,787,6347467,Jrjos23,5,Excellent Printer!,"A few days ago I received the Epson Eco Tank 4760 printer, I'm impressed with it because I did not have the slightest idea that these types of printers existed. I hadn't heard that the printer can be refilled. That is something I find great about this printer. I really liked that it saves the environment, and the amount of money that can be saved in ink. Currently we use a printer that is used only and exclusively to make necessary copies always for the theme of the ink (It's too expensive) since I feel that the ink cartridges is spent much faster. That's why I'm amazed with the amount of copies that this printer promises. Setting up the machine was extremely simple. Its took me around 10 minutes. All the steps in the manual were very clear. Putting the Ink in the printer was the first step and it's super easy. I followed the instructions on the screen and calibrated it. And that was all I did to be able to start using it. 

The machine comes with a digital keyboard where you can manage all the functions of the printer, like fax, copies, pictures, etc. It has all I need. But to be honest what excited me the most is the ink. I made several test copies and I did not feel that stress thinking that I was going to run out of ink. In addition the printer tells me how many copies have been made in color and in black and white. I can print on my phone and the connection is quick and easy. Another thing that I like is that the printer can fit 250 pages, and when I print it's not noisy. Now that I have this printer, the change is final. I will not go back to printers that use cartridges again.

787,788,6347467,Amydc,5,Great all in one printer,"I have been looking at the eco tanks since they came out and drooling over them. As a homeschool mom and a business owner, they seemed like a sound investment. I always hesitated because I wasn’t sure if they lived up to their hype. 

Let me tell you - they do! From the sleek appearance and small (considering) footprint to the ease of use... this printer is perfect. It doesn’t take up much more room on my desk than my $50 HP printer, which is a great thing. It prints without shaking the desk or making too much noise. 

The ink was very easy to install and the instructions were perfect. I’ve printer several things out so far and I love how it tells you what it’s doing on the bright lcd screen that you can flip up and down for convenience. If you’re not sure how many pages you have left, there are clear indicators as well as being able to see the ink in the tank. There’s also a feature that allows you to print a status report type page that tells you how many color pages and how many black and white pages you’ve printed so far. 

All in all, the print quality is excellent. Every feature is easy to use and this has to be the simplest ink installation ever. I really love it and am so glad to use it for my everyday printing needs.

788,789,6347467,MyShpngDiary,5,"Economical, nature friendly and fully loaded","I have used ink based printers in the past and was more or less done with them given the cost of cartridges. Yes, the printers were cheaper than laser, but maintaining them was the real killer with cartridges costing more than the printers themselves. 
The EcoTank printers have definitely changed that. The included ink was so easy to fill and absolutely spill free. The first time I filled the tanks, I had setup the printer on waste printer to avoid any spillage on my floor. However it was so easy and spill proof, the second time I filled the printer, it was over a carpet with no protection. Excellent system. I checked the price of the bottles in case I needed them anytime soon and they were cheaper than other cartridges with 10 times more ink. Very economical printer and great for the environment as well. The upfront cost may be a deterrent, however the printer pays for itself in less than a year , based on your printing needs.
Coming to the features - this is an absolutely incredible printer. I was able to install the device on my android device, my windows laptop and on my Echo Show - all without any issues and within 10 minutes each - all without any additional cables or wiring. This is so far evolved from the days when printer setup involved setup CDs, cables etc and still took ages to setup correctly.
The touch screen on the printer seems resistive rather than capacitive, but works well. The on-board menu is easy to use and helps setup wi-fi, scan etc with surprising ease.  I was able to also setup email address to which the scan could be directly uploaded and an email address where I can send any documents I needed printed on this printer. Amazing accessibility! I was also able to print photos from my mobile device and the Epson Iprint app also let me create collages to be printed. It couldn't get any simpler than that. 
When it comes to scanning, the ADF speeds up the process a great deal and the tray has been cleverly designed to be concealed when not in use so the printer's top looks flat. I can have the printer installed in a remote corner of my house and have it print docs all day long without any worry. 
Printing with Alexa was very responsive as well and the preset designs are very cute and beautiful.
I have not had the opportunity to use the fax yet but I am sure that would work as well given the quick response to wireless scans and prints.
All in all, you couldn't ask for more in an all in one. Affordable prints, wireless capabilities, ease of setup, accessibility by voice, email and wireless prints. I could go on and on and my list wouldn't end.

789,790,6347467,HomeOffice,5,Worth spending a little more,"We’ve had many sub-$200 ink jet printers over the years. I bet we have 20-30 old ink cartridges that don’t fit anything. I am done with that! The Epson ET-4760 is our first “tank” printer, and we are very happy so far. It was relatively easy  to set up, directions were clear and complete. The print quality set-up does take some time, but is very important and really not difficult. There is a FULL set of ink bottles included that I’m sure will last us over a year, perhaps two as advertised. The tanks actually hold that much. We have been able to scan to and print from HP laptop, iPhone, iPad, and MacBook, all through our household WiFi. Print quality is excellent. Scanning is quick for normal resolutions. It is smaller than I expected (this is a good thing) and holds a lot of paper. Powering up and down is very fast. Many of the printers we’ve had would clunk, chug, grind and bang for what seemed like minutes before they would perform the requested task. I hope the honeymoon with our new Epson lasts a long time!",1 year ago

In the past, I have only dealt with ink cartridges so this was new to me. Turns out, I was completely overthinking. The whole set up process from start to finish was easy. The included instructions were straight forward as well as the software that needed to be downloaded.  

The printer has an LED screen that is sized just right and the font is easy to read.  I am also pleased with the size of this printer. With it having so many features, I thought it would be larger. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with the quality of this printer. I have yet to print out a portrait but I am confident it will come out nice.

792,793,6347467,ESANTTI2019,3,Average printer,"I would like to say this printer has few of the latest technologies that are added but few pros and cons that I have experience throughout this process. Let’s start out with the pros. First, this printer is lightweight. When I used to have my old HP printer, which was 8500 Plus All in one, it was so hard to lift and put it back down at one spot, which was troubling for my back. But the Epson printer made my day by lifting it up so easy and this time I can move it anywhere I go either at home or at work. Second what it is so amazing about this printer is that I can really save money on ink cartridges. Spending over $115 dollars on ink cartridges for an HP printer was insane and while I did a little research on the cost for this printer, it was approximately $62 for all four-color ink bottles, so that’s money saving for me. Plus, don’t forget taxes and fees. The good thing about this printer is the scanner. Its lightweight and it doesn’t go down so easily comparing to the HP printer that I had which was semi heavy to lift and goes back down by itself then presses my hand as if I had a large rock on top of my hand. Now into the latest technology that I am so impressed about which was connecting to a device such as Google Assistant. Once I say something to Google about printing a document that is on file from my computer it prints it out for me which is cool, but I won’t go too far since I am not too fond of voice assistance device, they can hear me. Setting up the printer was easy but must read the instruction first. When I print a document, the noise was quiet and faster to print than my old computer was. The great part of it all is that if I am not using the printer for a few minutes, it goes into sleeping mode which save a lot of energy. Overall, Epson did a great job, kudos for that! 
There are some things that I really want this printer to improve. First, its hard for me to tap the LCD screen since its too small for my index finger to tap. I have a hard time tapping the QWERTY screen that I must clear it several times to make it right. While finishing adding ink, I waited for 10 minutes to charge the ink in result wasted approximately 3 mL of ink.  The word “Cassette” threw me off when it mentioned Load paper to the cassette. I always see the word “Tray” a lot on other printers, but “Cassette” is new to me. The cost of the printer I am not satisfied. I prefer for this printer to be around $300. The ink bottles are money saving but since this printer has a small LCD screen, lightweight, and unappealing, it cannot be worth $500. How it stated that the ink could last 2 year, I better keep a watch on that to believe it. The color pale white reminds me of a cheap printer that I used to have in the 1990s in which I left coffee stains. Harder to remove the stain, of course. To make it look appealing and safer, black will be the color favorite. Since the LCD screen small, make it look like a smartphone size, easier to press the button and easier to read 12-point font size since its small to read.

794,795,6347467,Dallasmom,5,Fantastic Multifunction!,"The Epson ET4760 is a medium duty inkjet printer with a lot of great features that set it apart from other printers. I installed and used the printer at both my workplace (small business) and my home. If you are looking for an attractive, extremely economical printer mainly for documents with some occasional graphics, this is your machine. Text and color documents look sharp and crisp, just keep in mind this is a multifunction machine meant to handle many kinds of tasks and will never be a fancy photo printer.

WHAT I LOVED
Ink tank system: This is the best feature and the execution is fantastic. The ink tanks solve the biggest pain point of inkjet printers – frequent replacement of expensive ink cartridges, and cartridges drying out over time. The box claims that you get 2 years of ink in the box – wow! Each ink bottle top is keyed in a different shape so that you don’t accidentally put ink in the wrong color tank. There was zero mess and the amount of ink the tanks hold is impressive. Word to the wise – go through the initial setup instructions carefully. To start, you fill up the tanks, but you will have a small amount of ink left in each bottle. You then run the printer through several tests and alignment processes which pulls ink into the system and creates room for the rest of the ink. Once you have it all set up properly, your bottles will be completely empty.
Design: This printer is modern and sleek in white and has a surprisingly small footprint making it easy to set up in a small area of your office or home. The LCD screen, though small, is responsive and easy to see – especially since the control panel can be swiveled up and down for the best viewing angle whether you are sitting down next to it or standing above it. My favorite design feature is the feeder tray on top which folds up flat when you don’t need it, keeping dust out and it just plain looks cool.

WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE
Setup: Be prepared to spend some time on this part. On my Win 7 system at the office as well as my Win 10 system at home, installation of the software took a really, really, long time. Once that part is done, there is a second installation process to update the firmware on the printer. I did it via USB at work which was successful once I got through it. Now, for some reason I could never get the printer fully setup wirelessly or via USB on my home Win 10 system. I ended up manually entering my Wi-Fi credentials into the printer directly and was able to print wirelessly after adding the printer through device manager. However, I am just using basic drivers and can’t adjust things like print quality and paper types. I got frustrated after trying multiple times and eventually gave up.
Photo Printing: The print quality for photos is not that wonderful. My color laser looks better. 
Noise: it’s pretty loud, even my boss commented on it from the other room!
Scanning: I wish I could name files rather than it just automatically saving it as a generic file name. You will have to go back and rename your scanned documents.

It is well made and has exceeded my expectations for my office and home printing needs. It prints great from a variety of devices and can handle small or larger printing needs. I like that it is compact and not too bulky.

The EcoTank ink system is my favorite feature.  The tanks are easy to fill with no mess.  I love that I can see how much ink is left with the ink windows on the front of the printer.  Yeah, no more ""Low Ink! surprises while printing.  The ink tanks hold a lot of ink and will last a long time.  It is nice to no longer have to purchase expensive ink cartridges that do not last very long.

The setup process was very easy and I was able to start basic printing after fifteen minutes or so.   I did go back and customized the settings to my preferences.   The control panel is bright and easy to see.  It is also straightforward and easy to use.  I also like that the control panel itself rotates up and down.  It allows you to make control panel adjustments while seated or standing.   I have multiple devices with different OS set up to print on this printer.  Setup for each device was quick and simple.  I also utilized Epson Connect so print documents can be emailed directly to the printer from anyone/anywhere.  I also enabled my Echo and love that I can have Alexa print through voice command.

I am happy with the print quality and that it prints quickly; both black and white and color copies.  I like that I can make adjustments to the quality on printing as needed.  I used a variety of paper types and was pleased with the print quality each time.  The printer has also done a great job keeping up with simultaneous print requests and never froze or jammed.  The paper tray is durable and I love that it can hold up to a half ream of copy paper.  The tray is easy to adjust for different paper sizes.   I really loved the ADF and that it will hold thirty sheets of paper.

You have the options to set up wired or wireless, with cloud print service options. The ink comes in easy to use containers.

The HP 7301 Smart Tank Wireless All-in-One Printer is a very reliable, feature-rich but inexpensive, easy to use device which will economically and quietly print large quantities of documents at an excellent quality level. 

HP Inc. is the personal computer and printer unit spun off from the original Hewlett-Packard company. (The remaining units became Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and are focused on the corporate market.) Hewlett-Packard was founded in 1939, operating out of a garage in Palo Alto and was the original Silicon Valley tech company. It designed and built precision instruments, then created its first minicomputers in 1966. These were followed by programmable calculators, including the famous HP-80 handheld calculator. In 1984 HP introduced its first desktop inkjet and laser printers. HP developed its own personal computers then merged with Compaq in 2002. Today HP is the second-largest personal computer manufacturer (after Lenovo.) The HP Imaging and Printing Group is the leading provider in the world for personal printers, scanners and supplies.

 Here are the key features of this great multifunction printer:

First impression: elegantly sculpted in a beautiful combination of arctic white, grey and slate with alternating colors and right angles that make the HP 7301 seem smaller than it is. It has a compact footprint (just 16.8” x 14.3”) and stands just 9.5” tall. HP cleverly designed the sheet feeder to fold flat when not in use, minimizing both the height and the width of the printer. The power cord has no bulky transformer on it so it adds to the clean look. Overall you will be pleased to share your office with this attractive unit, especially since it is very quiet. Wirelessly connected, it can be located in any convenient space – it does not need to be next to the PC it is serving. This is ideal for homes and small offices since you can also use this great device as a supplemental copier.

Setting up this printer is quite easy. HP protects the printer during shipping with tape around key parts, but all of the tape is bright blue and very easy to remove. The quick setup instructions are well-written and you could just read them. But an even easier method is to download the HP Smart app to your phone. Attach the power cord to the printer, turn it on and add some paper to the tray. Then just obey the illustrated step-by-step instructions in the app. Filling the printer ink tanks seems foolproof. Once ink is loaded, snap the print heads into position and an automatic alignment process will be conducted.

The HP Smart app will connect the printer to your wireless network. This was the easiest step in the setup process. The printer will automatically join the WiFi network to which your smart phone is connected. At that point the printer will be accessible to any computer or phone on that network. There are two alternates to the wireless connection option: attaching an Ethernet cable to your router or using a USB cable to your PC.

If at any point in the setup you need assistance, HP has prepared excellent videos to explain the process.

If you have a Windows PC just go to Settings, then Devices and select Add Printer. The HP 7301 printer will be discovered and the driver automatically downloaded. Any computer on your network should be able to access all of the printer features with the HP Smart app - a superbly designed software suite, containing easy-to-follow printing, scanning, copying, faxing and photo printing controls.

The HP 7301 has a large (250 sheet) paper capacity in the lower paper drawer. It loads easily and is adjustable for multiple paper sizes. To print envelopes you must remove the paper and adjust the paper guides to the width of the envelope. If you want to use legal-size paper, the end of the paper tray extends to accommodate the longer paper stock.

Print quality is really excellent, even in the economy (standard) mode. In the higher quality (business document) mode the print quality matches most laser printers I have used. The printer driver provides nice printing options like 2 on 1, 4 on 1 and up to 16 on 1 (number of page images on a single sheet of paper), borderless, scaled, fit-to-page, booklet and others. The most useful option is the automatic duplexing (two-sided printing) which it manages without drama.

Photo printing quality is quite good and will satisfy most purposes. (If you want really outstanding photo printing quality you should invest in a dedicated photo printer with more than three ink colors.) This printer’s color capability will be best used in printing business documents (graphs, multi-colored text, PowerPoint slide copies, etc.) and it does a very nice job on such tasks. The printing speed is not equal to that of a laser printer but certainly acceptable at about 15 pages/minute (black) and about 9 pages/minute for color documents (speeds estimated by my own testing.) For home use and most small offices this is more than adequate.

Scanning, at resolutions up to 1200 x 2400 dpi, can be managed from the HP Smart app which will scan to a PDF, stich large documents together and facilitate OCR, among other features. 

The copy function is accessed by two buttons on the printer, one for color copies and one for black copies. Hold the button down or tap it to increase the number of copies. It is fine, producing up to 99 copies in black print or color at 1:1 size ratio from each original. But the claim that it can shrink or enlarge originals, adjusting contrast, etc. should have an asterisk. The only way to do these functions is by first scanning the originals to a PDF, then print the PDF using the scale (zoom) setting on the print control page.

There are eight control buttons on the printer (Power, ID Copy, Color Copy, Black Copy, WiFi, Information, Resume and Cancel.) Most are self-explanatory. The “Information” button produces various reports, depending upon how long you hold the button and what other buttons you press at the same time. One puzzling button on the printer is “ID Copy” which is really only useful if you want to make a copy of the front and back of a card (e.g., driver’s license, credit card, etc.) on a single sheet of paper. While this may be useful at times, it seems odd that HP would devote a button to this task.

I tested each feature of the HP 7301 and all worked flawlessly (with the only quibble being the clumsy method of creating enlarged or reduced copies.) The unit seems very solid and I expect that it will work for years without complaint, given its HP heritage.

The most important feature of the HP 7301 is its massive ink tanks. It holds 90 ml of black ink and a total of 210 ml of color ink (70 ml each of cyan, yellow and magenta). Those ink tanks will print about 6,000 sheets of black ink documents and about 8,000 sheets of color documents. If you print ten pages a day that initial ink supply will last you nearly four years! The best part is the incredibly low cost of the ink. The refills for the ink tanks are far less expensive than replacement cartridges. The cost comparison to standard ink cartridges is amazing. A typical replacement inkjet cartridge for other printers costs $30 to $40 and will print 220-350 pages at an ink cost per page of about $0.09. The ink cost per page of the HP Smart Tank system is about $0.004 – less than 5% of the cost of a standard inkjet printer! 

With a traditional inkjet printer you probably minimize your printing to avoid costly ink cartridge replacements. This HP 7301 will free you to print much more readily since you have a cost per page lower than almost any other printing device on the market.

Those savings are due to the fact that you are not replacing the print head, as you must with each new ink cartridge, and the elimination of the plastic cartridge body cost. The ecological benefit of eliminating this waste is a nice bonus. And having a large supply of ink will eliminate that dreaded emergency trip to the all-night office supply store to replace an empty cartridge when you need to print a document for an early morning meeting!

One caution: Be sure to print at least one page in black ink and one color copy each month to keep the ink lines from potentially drying out from lack of use. 

In summary, the HP Smart Tank 7301 All-in-One Inkjet Printer/Copier/Scanner is superb. I give this great printer a full five stars and my unqualified endorsement. You won’t regret this purchase!",1 month ago
801,802,6477858,RBrylawski,5,Simply Awesome HP Printer,"This is hands down, the most expensive printer I’ve ever owned. And that is one of its virtues. If you’re like me, over the years, you’ve been through too many printers. And the one thing they all have in common is those little, all too expensive, never seem to last long, printer cartridges we all spend too much money on and never seem to have on hand when we need one. 

Enter the HP Smart Tank, 7300 Printer. This thing is a beast and that’s a compliment. This is the newest generation of printers, which uses reservoirs to hold large amounts of ink, which is beyond easy to fill and is supposed to last up to two years without needing to be refilled. And that my friends is if you typically print moderate to high volumes. Now I haven’t had this long enough to know, but I imagine the ink will last longer if you’re not a volume printer. HP suggests this printer is rated to print from 400 – 800 pages per month. That’s pretty high volume for a home printer. You should be able to print 8,000 color or 6,000 black pages using the Original HP ink which is included with the printer.

I’d like to start with giving major KUDOS to HP on the simple, I mean utterly SIMPLE set up process for this printer. Truth be told, we’ve been all in with HP for some time. We have two HP Spectre laptops and we’ve used HP Printers for years and have been extremely happy with them all. If you have great success with a product line, it just makes sense to stick with what works. 

Having never owned a printer of this type, I was honestly dreading the setup. But all you do is unpack the printer. Remove some tape here, some cardboard there and plug her in. Since we’ve already been using HP Printers, we already had the HP Smart app on both laptops and all iPhone’s and iPads. But that’s the next step after you plug into power. 

The HP Smart application literally walks you through the next steps with easy to understand (you honestly can’t mess this up) graphics. You connect to Wifi which HP says is Self-Healing, meaning network problems are resolved without the need for you to get involved. Then you empty the bottles of ink (which you can’t drip or make a mess with if your tried) and then install the Print Heads. That was the only part I missed as there is an orange assembly which looks important where the print heads go. And I missed that you simply remove, and discard said orange assembly and then install the print heads with ease. The printer springs into action, prints a test page, which you then scan to align the print heads and you’re done. I mean YOU’RE DONE. As I mentioned, they simply couldn’t make it any easier if they tried.

Now for the boring stuff, but necessary information. This puppy Prints, Scans, Copies, has an Automatic Document Feeder and of course is fully wireless. You can print up to 9 pages per minute, which is far more than any home printer I’ve ever owned. With up to 1200 x 1200 rendered DPI in black and 4800 x 1200 optimized DPI in color, there’s really nothing this printer can’t print well and in high clarity. I’ve printed lots of test pages and everything printed perfectly. It’s duplex printing capable as well. 

The HP 7301 is AirPrint (Apple iPhone/iPad), Mopria certified (which means it meets the Mopria Alliance standards offering a simple seamless way to print or scan to any certified multi-function printer or scanner), Android Print, Direct Print and you can print or scan using the HP Smart App which as mentioned you need to download to your computer and smart devices. 

Other boring, but you might want to know information is you can print up to 30 envelopes, do borderless printing, legal, Government Legal, Executive and photo printing. You can also print 99 copies at a time. Suffice to say, if you have a printing, copying, scanning need, I can’t imagine there’s anything this printer can’t do for you.

In case you can’t tell, I’m simply awed by this HP Smart Tank 7301 printer. It’s great looking. It can’t honestly be easier to get her up and running. And it’s incredibly versatile, provides high volume printing and with the two years worth of ink in this printer you won’t find yourself not being able to print on a lesser printer because you didn't know your print cartridge was getting low, and you didn’t have one on hand. Printing doesn’t get better or easier for the money than this. No it doesn’t.",1 month ago
802,803,6477858,Wishkid,4,Home/Office No Problem,"HP 7300 all in one printer. It arrived nicely packed with foam and plastic wrap to protect it. This printer is white and gray and it comes with refillable ink tanks. According to the manufacturer the ink will last up to two years. Of course that will depend on how much you print. It is very well made, it is not small and it has some weight to it. On the top it has the power button, LCD screen, and 7 additional functions including the Wi-Fi. Setting it up should be simple if the instructions were in the right order. It took me literally over 2hrs to get this printer to work, and I was following the instructions which are easy to read. The problem was the instructions were out of order. Before you can connect this printer to Wi-Fi, you first need to fill all the tanks with ink, install the print heads and calibrate the printer. That may seem simple but, I will list the troubleshooting steps at the end of this review in case you encounter the same problem. 

Download the HP Smart app, select add new printer and follow the instructions. Once it’s fully set up, using this printer with the app is very simple. The app is very straightforward; it looks and works the same across different platforms like Android and Windows, which are the one I used. The printer is a copier and a scanner as well . You can scan using the flatbed or the automatic feeder on top. The paper tray holds up to 250 sheets and the automatic feeder 35. It prints 15ppm in black and 9ppm in color. The printing quality is extremely good and the colors were very accurate. I will say the printing speed was about average and on par with other printers I owned. This printer is also capable of printing on two side sheets.

There are some advanced settings you can access through the app. Within those settings you can adjust pretty much every function and connectivity of the printer. There's even a quiet mode option. I tried that and didn’t notice any difference in the noise. I found some limitations when printing photos while using the app. You can either print fit to paper or borderless, if you want to make the picture to print smaller it wont let you. There’s an edit option to crop it but it will cut out the photo. There are other nice features such as Printables. They have a large selection of cards, craft, productivity and even coloring activities for kids. The best part is you can access them for free.

Overall this printer is perfect for the home or office. It has many ways to connect to it, either via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi direct, Air print, Ethernet, Internet printing and USB 2.0. It is cost saving, eco friendly, tanks are easy to refill and their spill free. It works as intended with great printing and scanning quality. In the box you get the printer, power cable, ink bottles, print heads and manuals. 

Setup Process:
First you need to fill all the ink tanks. You will notice when you open the cover the ink head carrier will not move to the center as it shows on the instructions (that was my experience). That being said after all the ink tanks are full, close the cover and power cycle the printer. When the printer is back on, you will notice less icons on the LCD screen. Open the cover, at this time the ink printing head carrier will move to the center. Remove the orange spill cap from the carrier and install the ink printing heads. Don't forget to remove the protective sticker from the ink printing heads. Once installed, the printer should print a Wi-Fi setup instructions and calibration page. If it doesn't print those pages, power cycle the device. Place the calibration page on the scanner flatbed and hit the scan button which will light up. At this time is when the actual printer is in setup mode ready to be connected to Wi-Fi. Now you can use the app to set up the printer.",1 month ago
803,804,6477858,ferrari,4,Finally - HP Joins the Big Tank Club,"The 7301 requires a bit more setup time than previous printers, due to filling the tanks with the provided ink, but boy, is that worth it! Since we already had an HP printer with the ""Instant Ink"" feature, the HP program recognized & installed the 7301. After printing the test and alignment pages, it was all ready to go. 
Having a new grandson, and my wife being a bit of a photo bug, the first test was to print photos from her camera, and to scan a few 8x10 glossies for possible framing. I defer to her in this area, as she does have a very critical eye for color, and I can't tell you how many printers she's rejected over the years for being fuzzy, off color, misaligned, etc. Not this time. She was extremely pleased with the sharpness, clarity, and color of the prints using a quality photo paper. 
Another nice feature of this printer is the removable/replaceable print heads. Ever had the print head clog after a period of disuse? Normally that means junking the printer, but here, you have the option to clean/replace. Given the cost of this unit, this is not a casual purchase as I've treated other printers in the past. 
But the 800 lb gorilla in the room is the ink storage tanks. There's a healthy supply included with the unit, and replenishment bottles are a far better buy than cartridges. 
There's a good reason for the missing star on the review - the tiny display. A difficult to read one line monochrome display on a top of the line inkjet? It really should've come with at least a 2x2 color LED offering some more info.
That said, I'm very glad HP decided to provide the option to put those high priced cartridges to bed. Looking forward to the 7301 being a long term companion in our home.",1 month ago
804,805,6477858,SteveC,5,Low cost printing for everyone,"I never really liked inkjet printers as I always thought the price of cartridges too high, and they’ve been that way as far back as I can remember. But with our color laser getting low on toner “and if you think inkjet cartridges are expensive”, and happen to see HP had the new Smart Tank AIO 7301 out so it was time to give a new printer a try.

Unboxing and first impressions:
The printer arrived in a nice looking, heavy weight logoed cardboard box nestled in a foam frame. I liked that upon opening the top of the box you could see the printer was inside a plastic bag that has handles for you to grab onto and pull the printer out “much easier to get out this way”. And along with the printer was a power cord, ink bottles “full ones”, a setup guide and a user’s guide. The printer itself is lighter and smaller than our laser printer, which surprised me, “not the weight but the size”.

Setting up:
The first thing the instructions have you do is plug in the printer “after removing all the packing material” and power it up. Then you download the HP Smart app to your phone “if you don’t already have it” and start the setting up process on the phone. “I didn’t attempt to try setting it up on my PC as the phone was handy and I wanted to try it out”. The app will guide you through setting up the network connection “also using WiFi instead of being directly hooked to my router”, then it will have you add the ink to the ink tanks. That part is super easy, just open the cover and lids on each ink tank, flip the lid on the ink bottle and shove it down over the tube protruding out the ink tank. Wait till the bottle empties and remove, replacing all the lids and covers. The next step has you install the print heads “nice that they are removable”, and once done add some paper and let the printer print the alignment page, which it will ask that you let scan it and that it, you’re ready to use.

I also had the HP Smart app on my Windows 10 PC and it immediately found the printer on the network and had me set it up along with the software for it.

Use:
There really isn’t much of an information screen on this printer, “that did surprise me” and only gives basic information. You really have to use the app to get to all the features and that’s really not an issue as the phone app gives you access to all settings and controls just like having a dedicated screen on the printer itself. There are buttons for Power, ID Copy, B&W or Color Copies, Information, Resume and Cancel, very basic and simple.

My first test I did was to check out the scanner and how good of a color copy it makes. I was extremely impressed with how well it made a copy of my Car and Driver magazine cover, it’s so close to the original it’s hard to tell other than the magazine has a glossy finish and the copy is plain ol copy paper. 

Our HOA had some flyers they wanted to send out so I volunteered to do some printing “with the ink tanks and low cost of ink I figured “why not””. I ended up printing 250 flyers on heavyweight 64lb colored paper and only had a very few “around 10” that weren’t aligned quite perfectly but that 64lb paper actually fed through the paper tray without issue, it wasn’t even curled up “which I figured it would be as our laser printer curls the heck out of the heavy paper if you use the tray and not the manual slot”. The prints were all done using black ink, printed on both sides, and again the printers duplexing worked perfectly and didn’t even curl up the pages. I did like that the printer, once one side was finished it would pause for approximately 10 seconds then print the opposite side “this pause lets the ink dry on the newly printed side”, so none of the pages smeared. Each print took right at 30 seconds to print “not the fastest, but I was printing on heavyweight paper, on both sides with some graphics, so in all I didn’t think that was bad at all, and it did so without a single jam.

I’ve also used the auto document feeder to scan a few pages and found it works perfectly and it’s very easy to scan a document from the Android app on my phone. I also like that the feed tray for the document feeder folds over to cover the feed slot when not in use, “many times I’ve tried to use the document feeder on other printers only to find something “like a paperclip” had been dropped down in there and you have to fish it out.

Conclusion:
With these huge ink tanks this is going to be the printer you want if you plan on doing a lot of printing. The bottles it comes with are good for about 6k pages of black or 8k pages of color, “that’s a lot of printing and should last the normal household over a year”. The ink is also very inexpensive when you have to get more, I actually don’t mind printing a lot from our inkjet printer now. The output is vibrant and clear, as good as our laser printer, and you can only really tell if you are looking at the page very very closely. The color copy really blew me away, it’s amazing just how accurate it came out.

Printing speed is on par with other printers we’ve owned, it’s not the fastest but it sure isn’t the slowest we’ve used before, and we can easily live with a slower print over the cost of printing any day as this is the way inkjet printers should have been designed all along. I also like the fact that the print heads are removable in case you wear one out or it gets plugged “replacements aren’t that expensive either”. Sound levels are on par with any other inkjet we’ve used and you’ll hear it if it’s on a desk next to you but I if you set it up on the other side of the room you’ll barely ever be bothered by it printing.

So if you are looking for a new printer, and want one that will not break the bank buying cartridges then this is going to be a printer you want to take a hard look at. It would even be fine for a SOHO setup, the cost of the bulk ink brings the overall cost per page within reach “and better” than our color laser printer.",1 month ago
805,806,6477858,sdunnin,3,Finally relief from the old ink game,"I really like HP’s idea of separating the ink storage from the print heads and thereby increasing the amount of ink storage which reduces the cost and number of times that refills are needed. It does almost feel as though HP tried to inconspicuously find ways for you to use more of the ample ink storage though. For example, pressing the (i) will immediately spit out a printer status information sheet with no questions asked, so if you accidentally press the button… poof you just printed an unwanted piece of paper.

Filling the ink tanks was incredibly easy and I really like the visual ink level windows. HP did an amazing job of designing the ink bottles to be no drip. Kind of makes it feels like the old days of refilling ink cartridges before printer companies started putting chips in them to make it hard to do so but now without the mess. I can say my experience filling the tanks was 100% mess free, however, I did get a little ink on my hands when taking the seals off the top of the bottles so be advised. Each bottle will exactly fill its color’s tank so there is no guessing on amount to put in. There is nothing that I can tell that would prevent someone from loading an ink color into the wrong tank. I would hate to find out what kind of problems that would cause so be careful. 

Unboxing was simple but the orange guard contraption HP has you discard is rather large and seems like a wasteful amount of plastic. The setup provided several hurdles for me. First off, I wasn’t really a fan of the recessed power plug, it is a good inch or so inside of the housing and harder that is seems that it should have been to plug the cord in. Somehow, I must have gotten the unit out of wireless setup mode maybe by inadvertently pressing the Wi-Fi button after plugging-in, but I don’t really know. Anyway, what that meant is I was totally unable to complete the Wi-Fi setup until doing a factory reset. If you see on the LCD display a blinking Wi-Fi icon with an exclamation you will likely have this problem… that’s where I ended up. After searching online, I found instructions on HP support site for resetting printer. Once reset the setup wizard worked well and walked through all aspects of setup including installing ink and print heads. Once setup the printer is easy to wirelessly connect and print from mobile devices and Windows or Mac computers with no special setup required.

I was able to connect to and access printer settings with the HP Smart App on an iOS phone, Windows PC, and iMac and it looked and functioned pretty much the same on all platforms. The app is easy to use and provides lots of printer information and configuration options. You will need this app often though, as unlike other HP printers I have owned very little configuration can be accomplished outside of using the Smart app. There are certain things you can do with various combinations of the physical buttons but good luck trying to remember how to do that without having the manual handy. This seems like such a throw-back design and is so non-intuitive as to be nearly unusable to the average user. I just don’t understand the design decision of not utilizing the LCD for some rudimentary options.

The LCD display is only for displaying the most basic of printer information with mostly icons and numerical error codes related to printer issues that are not easily identified without looking them up. Various types of status information can be printed out via pressing the (i) and other buttons in various ways. Other HP printers I have used have made much better use of the display than this one does. The user interface buttons on the front of the unit are small and hard to read, especially when not illuminated. Also, the setup guide is rather sparse and just guides you to plug in turn on and open the app. If you want to learn more detailed information about operating your printer you will have to go online and download the full users guide which is not included in the box.

On the positive side print quality is very good and print speed is also excellent. Photo printing is decent as well for a non-photo printer. Copies can be using the document feeder or placing document directly on the glass. I tested color and B&W copies of various types of documents with excellent results. Also scanned documents to my PC using the HP smart app and the Windows fax and scan app, both of which were easy to use and produced quality scans of documents and photos. There is unfortunately no way to initiate scanning from printer though.

I had an issue with scanning where the scan buttons would not illuminate when opening a document or inserting a document into feeder rendering the copy buttons non-functional. Only power-cycling the printer would get it working again. A couple of days later when contacted by HP support miraculously the problem went away, and I could not reproduce it with tech on the phone. 

I really like the ease of wireless printing, output quality and speed and am really excited about the large ink capacity. My frustrating setup experience and the lackluster printer interface probably cost the printer at least a star for me.",1 month ago
806,807,6477858,RonH,5,A great printer,"The HP Smart Tank inkjet printer comes well packaged with a lot of attention to detail. I like that it's wrapped in a plastic bag with handles to use to get it out of the box. All the loose parts are taped down, both inside and out. 

Setup was simple and the software guides you through everything step by step with pictures and animations. Once the heads and inks are installed, you print an alignment page then scan it and the printer automatically fixes any misalignments. I had it up and working in about 15 minutes. Once the printer was set up, adding it to other computers was easy, they all found it quickly and added the drivers. You can print from a pc without installing the HP Smart Ap but for full functionality, the app needs to be installed. The printer also has a web server that you can use for some features. There is an LCD display on the front of the machine that has various icons to assist. I found the LCD a little difficult to see in dim light.

The printer doesn't use combination print head/ink cartridges; rather, the printhead and ink tanks are separate, allowing you to simply refill the ink tanks as needed. Full bottles of ink are included in the box which HP says will print 8000 pages of color and 6000 pages of black. Replacement bottles of ink cost about $15 each making the cost per page much lower than cartridge-based printers.

Prints on plain paper are very good with deep rich blacks and nice color accuracy. I didn't notice banding on images or solid blocks of color. The printer has auto-duplexing for printed pages only and the software has options for which side you want the edge to be on as well as allowing you to print multiple pages per sheet to save paper. The printer will take paper sizes from 3x5 index cards to 8.5x14 inch legal paper, envelopes and photo stock. All paper stock is placed in the paper tray; there is no single sheet bypass feed.

Printing photos on plain paper and on generic glossy photo paper using plain paper settings were acceptable, however when using the glossy paper setting with my paper stock they came out much darker and unusable. I believe this is the fault of my generic paper rather than an issue with the printer. As with all printers, using recommended/brand paper results in a better finished product.

There are dedicated buttons for copying; however, the HP Smart app is required for scanning. There is no dedicated button on the machine to initiate a scan and have it sent to a printer. The app has several other nice features like Mobile Fax. Using the app, you can send a fax to anyone without having to connect your printer to a landline. Unfortunately, this only works for sending, you are not able to receive faxes. You can also set up shortcuts for features you use regularly. My only complaint with the app is you have to set up an account and sign in to use many of the features. 

Overall, I really like this HP Smart Tank printer. There are a couple of things I would have expected on a device of this price: backlit LCD and single sheet paper feeder for example. I also believe that printer manufacturers are going to get their money either through ink refills or initial cost of the device. While per page costs for ink are considerably less, this is one of the more expensive inkjet printers I've seen. All things considered, this is a great printer and I highly recommend it.",1 month ago
807,808,6477858,Woo151,5,Excellent All-In-One!,"I haven't had a need for a printer at home for a long time, but since I am now working from home instead of the office, this Smart Tank 7301 is truly a god send. I love how easy it is to not only set up, but also use and refill.

In the box comes with the printer well protected, printer heads, color ink and black ink bottles, power cord and the usual paperwork. 

Set up was a breeze and the App made it super easy and straight forward. Set by step it tells you exactly what needs to be done all the way from plugging it in to scanner alignment. The steps even tell you when to remove the protective plastics and cardboard. I'll admit I was hesitant to do the ink bottles, but the spill-free bottles made it so even a child can do it. 

There are many ways to connect to it. WiFi requires the PIN inside the printer if you are connecting multiple PCs to it that way. BT, LAN, and old school USB. I have my Phone, 2 tablets, 2 laptops and 4 PC all connected to it at once. 

Out of the box with the ink, HP claims to give you 8000 color or up to 6000 black and I can attest to that fact. Working from home, I have already gone through 3 packs of paper (500 per) and even a few hundred for personal use including a TON of shipping labels. The color/black lvls hardly broke a sweat. 

Printing is by all means not slow for an inkjet at all, but now super fast as a laser. It to me is perfect when printing out my work packages to ship off. Never once have I caught myself staring at the printer waiting for it to finish.
Even the scanner is super hi def at making copies. I was quite surprised when making a scans and seeing how they looked on my PC. 

In the end, this all-in-one is lives up to it's name. Can do a massive amount of printing before a refill is needed, great connectivity options and fast for an inkjet. I would recommend this printer in a heartbeat but even quicker to people like me working from home.",1 month ago
808,809,6477858,Harrkev,3,A curious mix of fantastic and bad.,"This is the most unique printer that I have experienced, and that uniqueness is not in a good way. This is not a bad printer at all, but it has enough quirks that you should be aware of before you purchase. Before I begin, I should note that I also have recently set up an Epson ET-series printer (direct competition that also uses a “tank” system with inexpensive ink bottles). So I will be comparing the two models.

First, the printer does NOT have any sort of reasonably usable display on it. It has an LCD display that shows several icons and can show a two-digit number. That is it. The first printer that I received had a hardware defect, and the printer could do nothing besides flash an exclamation point at me. You have to go to a computer or phone to even see what the error is. Competition from other brands generally feature a color display that can show you in text what is going wrong, and even show pictures on how to clear the problem. Not so with this.

Normally, I can plug in a printer and get it set up quite easily (install consumable, connect to WiFi, etc.). After it is running, I can then install drivers on the computers in the house. This printer is different. You NEED either a computer or phone to set it up. The phone app is required to move the print head carriage over to the middle so that you can actually install the repleacable print heads. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly a different direction from any other printer that I have set up in the last few decades.

Setup also requires loading the paper, and the Android app gave no advice on how to do this. I have set up enough printers where figuring this out was easy, but it fails the “grandpa” test where I am pretty sure that my father-in-law would be confused for a while. You also need to add the ink to the tanks. The ink bottles are NOT keyed in any way. If you are not careful, you could dump cyan ink in the yellow tank, and nothing will stop you. Not a big deal for most, but another “grandpa test” fail. Epson has the bottles keyed so that it is impossible to put ink in the wrong tank.

Setting up on the PC is easy. No manual driver download. You just do the normal “add printers” thing in Windows, and it is automatically set up for printing. The proper app is even downloaded from the Microsoft store. However, here is where things take a strange turn. If you want to actually scan anything, you have to use the “HP Smart” app that REQUIRES you to create an HP account. No account, no scanning at all. I find this to be rather abusive. What if you don’t want to make an account? Plus the app defaults to collecting usage metrics and sending advertising. The account also wants to send you advertising too (make sure to opt out of this). I have several children in my house in high school and college, and every one of them either needs to use my password, or make their own HP account. Bad move.

However, once everything is finally set up, it seems to work well. Printing is pleasingly fast and sharp, and the cost of ink should be quite low in the long term. The paper tray holds quite a bit, and the automatic document feeder in the scanner works well. The app scans all pages and then lets you make adjustments, finally saving them to a jpg or a pdf. The only drawback is that you seem to have to adjust contrast and brightness per individual page; I could not easily find a way to adjust all pages the same way.

Finally, I tried printing a photo from my Android phone (Google Pixel 4a 5g with OLED display). I also printed to the Epson EcoTank printer too. The colors from the Epson looked spot on compared to the phone’s display, while the HP seemed just a little bit more brown/yellow. For utility work (charts, graphs, etc.) this will be unnoticable, but I just thought that I should mention it. It is possible that a future app update may fix this. The one big advantage of this printer is that the print heads are easily replaceable, and the alignment stage consists of printing an alignment sheet and then putting it on the scanner. That is a nice touch that I have not seen the competition do. 

So this is a solid printer that works well, but it has a few quirks. However, the competition is similarly priced, and may not have all of these quirks.",1 month ago
809,810,6477858,JorgeST,5,"Wireless, long lasting","I have used several printers from this brand in my past. When I think of printers I usually think of this brand or another leading name in the office equipment space. I have noticed that over the years that this brand's quality has increasingly improved. Adding wireless capabilities, listening to the customer's well known ""ink price gouging"" mind set, and even making the printers very quiet (comparatively to older models) have been only a handful of enhancements that I have noticed over time. This all in once really aligns with the previous sediment. The high capacity ink tank makes it easy to refill and keep levels high, while not breaking the bank doing so. The design is light weight, yet sturdy while providing all of the prerequisite ""all in one"" features, wireless functionality being one. All in all I am pleased with this printers as its easy to set up, easy to refill with cost effective ink, and very easy to troubleshoot. If you are looking for a cost effective printer that has longevity and all of the all in one feature this is the model for you.",1 month ago
810,811,6477858,computerboy,2,"Print wells, but know this..","Smart Tank 7301 is Hewlett-Packard's top-of-the-line large tank (called Megatank and Ecotank by their competitors). HP got on the bandwagon when the other two manufactures were making loads of money. They did not do a good job. 

I put it through thorough testing and I have concluded that while it print well, it has a few shortcomings that if this were the only large tank printer, it would be a great buy – but compared to its competitors, this printer should be priced about half of what it is retailed for.

The printer came in a very well packed box – typical – just like any other printers out there – there is no manual but a small sheet of a folded brochure on the quick setup. It doesn't go into detail whatsoever about how to install the printheads and how to pour in the inks. I had to download the Adobe Acrobat manual to go over it so I will not make a mistake. It is not a simple printer, and I had to make sure what is installed first – the printheads, or the inks? (The answer is you have to fill the tanks with the inks first.)

Unfortunately, it has to be done extremely carefully. Another brand – the tips of the bottles are clearly designed so it cannot be inserted into the wrong tank (wrong color). If you do not think it is serious, imagine putting water in your engine instead of oil. There is no way to purge the ink if the incorrect color is used. This is an oversight and some users who are not careful will make a mistake if they are in the hurry.

I tried to download the full driver (it is a huge file) on HP website, and the setup program did not recognize the printer even when it was connected through the USB port. I switched to few different ports – directly connected to the computer – it still did not recognize the printer. And by the way, the link on the website of HP was broken for this particular driver. I had to go to third party which fortunately links me to HP own website but with a different URL address. Of course, I made sure it is for this particular printer, and not for an incorrect one. This is a horrible oversight for someone who want to set this up for office use (IT department). 

I had to download the “app” which is more like a toy and it still did not recognize the printer. I had to reboot the computer for that to happen. (I am running Windows 11 and the driver that I mentioned above was made for Windows 11.)

Once it started working, the printer printed quite quickly and thankfully on duplex (both sides of the paper) at the default setting, fast enough for me to use at work. (I set this up first at home, and I took you to work because I print a lot at work.) It is a bit loud, but I didn't expect it to be quiet (and print that quickly). 

Another criticism that I have is that I could not see the buttons at all. Sometimes it lights up, but when I wanted to make a test copy with the automatic document feeder, I had to play around with the button. I had to look at the PDF manual since the provided setup sheet did not go into it at all. They could have invested in a small LCD screen that has messages that the user can understand. It is just a bunch of icons. I would like to be able to control the printer at the printer, and I don't want to do it via the computer. How did this thing come out of the design department is beyond me?

I have Adobe Acrobat and I wanted to scan the documents to create a 10 page PDF file – it works – very slowly – and only the maximum of 300 dots per inch. And it only scans one side – meaning you have to flip the page over to the other side. It deserves a duplex (one pass) sensor. If you have a lot of documents to scan, you are going to be frustrated.

Next problem the paper tray – you can fit the letter sized paper, and it will extend to accommodate a legal sized paper. I thought I was missing something to keep the papers in place – it is in there. At the end of the tray the stack of paper is made so it is ""fanned"" for the ease of the printer to feed it – but at the other end of the papers (toward you), the edge of the paper just sits there. I don't know how well this will work because if the papers move back just a bit, the printer will not be able to pick one sheet up at all.

Another shortcoming is for something that because this much, there is no manual bypass tray. If you want to print an envelope, you have to take the whole stack of paper out and insert one envelope. How much can it cost to add that feature? 

Lastly, there is no maintenance tray. What that is is when the printer does the cleaning of the heads, it dumps a small amount of ink onto a sponge pad (to unclog the print heads.) When the pad is too soaked with wasted ink, it will have to be replaced. There is no way to do that here without this assembling the printer (and you are not supposed to). For something that because this much, they should make a replaceable maintenance tray. 

The other two brands which shall be nameless, have them for more expensive models. So this printer is okay for home use, but if you use it a lot at work, one day it will stop printing because the pads will have to be replaced and you will not be able to do it yourself. You may have to send it in. This is a major flaw and it makes it a home use only. Yes, print a few thousand pages and opps - it stops working. 

It is an acceptable printer and I was able to set it up wirelessly using the app. If they were no other large capacity inkjet printer in the market, it is a decent printer (with all the shortcomings that I have mentioned), but compared to the other two brands, for the same price, you just don't get enough with this. 

Not recommended for the price you are expected to pay because there are better choices (that do more) out there.",1 month ago
811,812,6477858,1ShadowFox1,4,Quiet & Capable,"I have had quite a few HP Printers and each and every one of them has impressed. This HP Smart Tank is no different... after setup.

Initial setup of this printer was a chore. It's fickle, requires use of an app, and if you wait too long or press a wrong button it causes utter chaos and the machine and app give you minimal feedback to advise you of the issues. My printer requires two complete resets and an uninstall and reinstall off the HP App to get working. All of my other HP Printers had a small touch screen and this probably would have made all the difference in setup, but regardless, I was able to get it done.

The printer comes with a copious amount of ink, which is awesome. Nothing is more frustrating than running out of ink when printing a project or other important work. This printer also uses bottles in addition to cartridges, which is interesting.

After setup, using the printer was a breeze! No drivers to install, no additional setup, just click print and go. Or feed a document, click scan, and go. No fuss, no problems.

Side Note: This printer works REALLY well for documents. And although I know it's not the purpose of this printer, I would not use this model to print pictures. I tried it as I have been surprised by other HP printers being able to produce great quality picture prints. This printer will not.

Overall, this is a great home office printer. It's quiet. It's capable. You just need to get it up and running first. Once setup is complete, you are smooth sailing for years to come.",1 week ago
812,813,6477858,AlanD963,5,No More Inkjet Cartridges!!,"A wonderful feature of this printer is the “Smart Tank” system. It’s surprising no one ever came up with this idea before. In the past when your inkjet printer was running low on ink, especially with the four-cartridge design so prevalent now, the cost of replacing the ink cartridges was crazy. I dreaded printing something and seeing a pop-up message saying something like “The Cyan Cartridge is Low.” Well now, instead of expensive ink cartridges, THIS printer is built with four ink tanks, and it comes with a bottle of ink for each color. The filling system is pretty ingenious and spill proof. You press down slightly on each bottle as you fill each tank, the ink flows in the tank without spilling a drop. I filled all 4 tanks and there wasn’t a drop of ink on my hands or on the desk. Replacing the ink bottles is much cheaper than having to purchase a separate ink cartridge for each color.

Now all that economy and convenience isn’t worth much if your print quality isn’t what you wanted. After set-up, my test print paper came out sharp and clear, totally near-laser quality. 
Now came the real test for me. I wanted this printer mainly for photo printing. I already have a laser printer in my den, which is great for documents, not at all good for photo printing. 
I put in a sheet of HP Advanced Photo paper, selected the premium paper in the app software and hit “Print.” Slowly the paper advanced through the printer and the results were BEAUTIFUL. As good as I could possibly expect. 
I’m very happy. Now I’ll be able to print as many photos as I want, saving money on those ink cartridges (and you can easily see the ink levels on the tank windows on the front of the printer.)

It’s all good. In fact the only negative I could find with this printer is the problem I had connecting it to Wi-Fi. The HP Smart app could not see it on my network. None of the included instructions really explained the proper steps to successfully connect using my computer. I’m glad my kids were out of the house so they wouldn’t hear my inappropriate language. Let me save you the trouble, here’s what finally worked for me. 
First remove all the packaging, on the outside and inside of the printer, being careful not to miss anything. Then BEFORE attempting the Wi-Fi connect, you need to fill all 4 tanks with the included ink bottles. At this point you install the two print heads. (I used an HP YouTube video to see how to do both.) 
NOW, you can start connecting to Wi-Fi by following the directions in the included “Reference Guide”. At this point your printer will ACTUALLY PRINT OUT the Wi-Fi setup instructions with all the information you need! None of it is intuitive. I had to use the WPS button on my router to finally succeed.

Anyway, once your all ‘hooked up’ I think you’ll LOVE this printer. They claim it comes with enough ink for 6,000 black pages or 8,000 color pages. I can’t judge the accuracy of that statement, but it does seem it would be way more economical than the old ink cartridge system, and the print quality is as fast and good as any printer I’ve seen. I don’t think you can ask much more from a printer.",1 month ago
813,814,6477858,stangapds,5,Fantastic AIO Tank Printer!,"HP as finally joined the game here and got in the fight for ending the war and ridiculously expensive ink cartridges! Unboxing was straight forward, the usual care was taken to protect potential moving parts, the handles on the bag the printer sits in made it easier to remove from the box. 

Setup was straight forward and simple. Using the Windows software installer, it guides you through the very easy setup process. One word of caution, if you don’t have super amazing aim with filling liquids into containers, you may want to wear gloves as you squeeze ink into the print heads. It’s not very hard to spill, and once you have ink on your hand, it’s difficult to easily remove. After you get the physical assembly/setup complete, the printer walks through your first couple of prints, one of which happens to be a calibration page to help fix any alignment issues in the print head. This process overall only takes about 20 minutes. 

A couple of major points here that make this quite an amazing printer: first the fact that you don’t need expensive ink cartridges that just continually seem to always be depleted or dried out. This printer utilizes storage tanks for the ink, and it includes all the bottles of ink you need out of the box to last you up to 2 years! The second major point that makes this unit even more flexible, is the ability to remove and clean the print head. There’s times where my home office printer could go a month or two in between printing something. This usually causes the print head or ink cartridge to dry out and become unusable. Cleaning the print head in a printer that doesn’t allow removal also wastes a ton of ink, which then makes printing those occasional jobs extremely expensive. 

The print quality is fantastic for this level of printer. One think I’d highly recommend is to make sure you are using specific HP paper, the prints just look better using the correct HP paper. I’ve used inkjet printers before that have 7 or more ink cartridges to try and achieve the best color results, and this printer matches their quality easily with no issues. Printing some high-quality photographs on HP Glossy Photopaper output some amazing look photos. They were colorful, crisp, accurate, and best of all, affordable to print using the ink tank method. The paper tray holds about 250 sheets of paper, and can scale down to a 3” x 5” card and up to 8.5” x 14” legal size. The ADF (auto document feeder) on to of the machine can hold a stack of about 35 pages for those bigger document scans. The printer speed is quite solid, about 4 seconds per black and white page, about 7 seconds for color pages. The time to the first page is very reasonable as well. 

By far the easiest way to connect up is to use the guided software setup using Wi-Fi. It allows you to place the printer wherever needed and eliminates the need for anything more than a little bit of surface space and a power outlet. Additionally, you can connect via Bluetooth, hard wired ethernet, or a USB cable. It supports Wi-Fi direct printing and AirPrint right out of the box. I do run multiple apple devices, so it’s extremely convenient to be able to print directly from my iPhone or iPad as needed. 

I love this printer and I’m extremely happy to have it available. You can print for ages using the included ink, and even when you need to refill, the refill bottles are inexpensive. The only improvement I could see here is adding a slightly bigger screen. While you can easily control all of the printer functions from your computer or smart phone, having the ability to interact with settings, send scans to email, etc right from the device is hindered without a nice touch screen display. Overall, I’d highly recommend this printer for anyone looking to affordably print from home, especially if you print a lot. The savings you’ll end up with by using the tanks of ink will well pay off the cost of the printer.",1 month ago
814,815,6477858,HBODude,4,Solid printer so far,"We've had this printer almost a month.  I rarely give anything 5 stars but this is close - probably 4.5.  So far so good.  We decided to crack open the checkbook & buy a more expensive printer hoping for better overall results plus the the refillable ink wells was a big selling point.  Our use is primarily home office and family/school printing needs.
Pros:
I can honestly say it was probably the easiest s/u to our network yet.  Prints very fast & the colors are accurate for documents.  I haven't printed photos yet  Also like that the print heads are easily replaced if they go bad.
Cons: 
We initially had an issue with the paper feed when trying to double side but i took the trays out & reseated all the internal covers & that seemed to fix it.  Doesn't have a phone line fax port but if i need to go ""old school"" i can always fire up my old printer. No other issues so far.

Overall this seems to be a much more solid printer than the cheaper versions we've purchased in the past - hope it lasts a while.",3 weeks ago
815,816,6477858,Robs,5,Solid HP Printer for color printing,"The HP Smart Tank 7301 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer provides a solid printing and scanning experience. Setup is quick; simply remove the tape and internal cardboard, plug it into the wall and power it up. I downloaded the HP Smart app on my Android phone, and it walked me through setting up the WiFi, filling the ink tanks, installing the printheads, loading paper, and aligning the printheads. The Smart Tank printers do require the ink tanks to be filled before the printheads are installed. This is a different startup process than non-tank printers so I highly recommend the HP Smart setup process for detailed animations that explain what you need to do. Once you see how it is done, it is very easy to fill the tank due to the spill-proof refill design. The HP Smart Tank 7301 can work on either 2.4GHz or 5GHz WiFi frequencies which I appreciate because I can have it on the frequency with the least devices. If the printer has issues with connectivity, it has the capability to automatically connect to another frequency to keep print jobs rolling. It can also connect via Bluetooth, USB 2.0, and Ethernet cord. The printer does come with HP32XL black ink, HP31 Cyan ink, HP31 Magenta ink, and HP31 Yellow ink which is enough ink to get 8000 color pages or 6000 black pages. The printer has 8 buttons facing up and a 2-line LCD display that face up near the front of the unit. I appreciated that the buttons will contextually light up depending on the job the printer is doing so that you can quickly see which buttons may be useful for that particular job. It does have ID printing which is a nice feature that will scan both sides of an ID and print them both on one side of a piece of paper. There is an auto feeder that works for both printing and scanning which holds about 35 sheets. Paper capacity is 250 sheets which is a nice amount for handling several large print jobs before needing to be refilled. The print speed was impressively fast, with color jobs running at 9 pages per minute and black/white jobs running at 15 pages per minute. With a recommended monthly printed page volume of 400 to 800 pages (same for scans), this printer easily handles the modest of work that I have for it. I think this would be a nice printer for the entire family to use or even the small home office. I appreciate that HP has committed to more environmentally friendly hardware, with 25% of the plastic on this printer coming from other recycled electronics. Overall, the HP Smart Tank 7301 is a very nice entry into the field of family or small office color printing. It is easy and intuitive to use, quick to setup, and performs flawlessly. I do recommend utilizing the HP Smart app for easy printing, scanning, and diagnostics.",1 month ago
816,817,6477858,DarthNeyehilus,5,Great Printer for All,"Overall, the HP Smart Tank 7301 is a great printer for home office users that don’t want/require the bulk of a true laser jet printer. 

Unboxing the printer was easy, as are all HP printers nowadays and setting everything up was also a breeze. If you haven’t set up an HP printer lately, they’re all essentially the same thing: plug the printer in, turn it on, download the HP Smart Print application on either your computer/laptop or smartphone, and then follow the instructions to get connected. 

It’s really that simple, honestly. 

Once you’re up and running you can print/scan/copy straight from your device’s controls, as long as your printer is actively connected to your wifi and has a signal. 

As far as printing speeds go, this won’t blow you out of the water, but it gets the job done. I will say, from my time with the printer, the overall quality output seems to be higher than other small/home office printer lines from HP like the Envy. Using dedicated photo paper delivered quality results which I, as a professional photographer, enjoyed. 

I wouldn’t use this for true client work, but for prints smaller than 8x10 is a good choice. 

The biggest selling point of the 7301, though, are it’s ink tanks. These are supposed to deliver longevity of a toner cartridge in the form factor of an inkjet-based printer. Time will tell but we’ve printed a decent amount and I don’t think I’ve seen the tanks budge on capacity. 

At any rate, I’d recommend this printer to most people: it’s small, easy to set up, and can do almost everything needed for day-to-day printing for small office spaces.",1 week ago
817,818,6477858,jonnyd2885,5,"Great smart printer, without wasteful cartridges.","The HP Smart Tank 7301 is a great all-in-one inkjet printer with great wireless features and makes use of individual ink tanks rather than expensive and wasteful ink cartridges. It is a great printer for anyone looking to purchase a smart printer and is ideal not only for regular home use but also for home office or small business use. 

The fact that the paper is loaded into a tray is great for me since I print fairly infrequently as it helps prevent dust build-up on the pages prior to printing, and the ability to load in several pages to scan is great for the times that you need to scan multiple documents or multiple pages all at once. The scanner is fairly fast with excellent quality and is much better than cheaper scanners where you have to scan each page individually on the flatbed scanner, while the HP Smart Tank 7301 does still feature a flatbed scanner for more one-off scans, the feed tray for scanning documents is great and works best for me and what I end up using it for regularly.

By far the greatest and most useful feature for me of the HP Smart Tank 7301 has been its wireless connectivity, from just being able to connect over wifi to the best feature, in my opinion, the ability to print using AirPrint or with ChromeOS has been the greatest. The fact that I do not have to install an application on every device just to print out a page from my phone is the greatest thing and it's kind of shocking that it isn't more common on these kinds of devices. While I appreciate the fact that HP's application has some additional and helpful features for the printer, I am tired of having to install applications for one-off products just to be able to use basic functionality, and for a printer the ability to print from any phone or tablet documents that my friends or family may need and not having to install an application to do it is great. AirPrint and Android's similar technology have been around for a long time now and while some printers make use of this technology, most manufacturers, including HP depending on the printer, want you to download their horribly buggy applications just to be able to print documents from your phones and I think this is just a horrible experience. I personally am going to make it a priority from now on to only purchase a new printer if it features these technologies and I am glad to see it built into this printer and I hope that HP will continue this trend in other models of their printers.",1 month ago
818,819,6477858,DarR,5,Great printer in a digital world,"I know ideally I should not be printing on paper any more since everything can be digital. However, I still always find myself needing a printer. From parking permits, to physically signing docs and sending them out, to digitizing my document clutter—these are still a necessity for me.

Let me list out the basic things that HP has always been good at—installation and seamless integration with my PC. The HP Smart app has been so easy for my PC and phone. Putting it together is done step by step, guided—especially that I am new to ink tanks, it was made easy for me to set it up, without spilling! The bottle nozzle to the printer tank is well-made, I didn’t waste a drop. The usual connectivity setup is easy as well because the app has been very easy to use. Plus I have been a smart app user for years so the HP printer services has been very easy for me to use. 

So the main uses for the printer are as expected of an HP printer. Clean crisp print lines, and the print looks good even on crappy paper. Print speed is decent for home office. Scanning is quick and the document feeder takes on crumpled sheets easily! So HP does what they do best.

But you know what the best thing about this printer is? I read how this HP 7301 is made from recycled materials. That is huge for me. It is bad enough that we still do business on paper— I sometimes feel guilty when I still have to print but cannot help it because business still requires it. Having the tank already makes me avoid subscribed ink cartridges. Then you have a printer that is responsibly made. It helps reduce my carbon footprint. And, speaking of footprint, given all that this one can do, it manages to be small on the desk. All the reductions done by this printer are actually pluses!

This Smart Tank printer is so easy to refill and comes with enough ink to last a couple of year, maybe even more.

My black and white prints look better than my more expensive printers at work and the colors look great as well. Prints come out super fast with amazing clarity.

I think fusing the practicalness of being able to preview the photo on your phone is great so you aren't wasting the film, which can be a bit pricey, of course.

First things first, I really liked the extremely informative box that it comes in explaining all the different cool features that this multifunction printer can do.
Unpacking the box, I really liked how everything was secured enough to ensure no damage through the shipping process, but at the same time very easy to unpack and set up. Most importantly, I really liked the fact that I didn’t have to start putting together pieces and trays on multi-part cords. All that was required (the starter toner and power cord) was securely placed under the top tray.
Setting up the printer with my computer and network was also very smooth, very easy process and had it done in minutes. The extremely clear and precise setup guide was very helpful with anything I wasn’t sure about. I really love the very clear and responsive touch screen.I did have one issue with the paper tray not taking the paper properly, and that the tray has a little wiggle room at the end, but after the first confusion everything else was very smooth. I happened to be setting it up wirelessly, but it would’ve been nice to have had the Ethernet cable and or USB cable included. 

Setting up the scanner to my computer through my network, through the cloud services, and through email was all extremely smooth and very clear options to help configure
The printer quality is very good, speed is pretty decent (is toner after all) but even for color printing, it was pretty good!
To round up:
Pros:
Double paper tray with a 500-page capacity total
Great scanning capabilities
Love the touch screen 
Wi-Fi/NFC 

Cons:
Toner printer


I really like this printer, and I have it setup in the middle of my office, and It really – truly is a WORKFORCE PRO PRINTER!

I love having double-sided scanning and double-sided printing. 
I thought it would be a nice to have feature, until the first time I copied a 2-sided form with a single press of the button and no flipping and reloading pages.
Scanning and printing speed and quality are very impressive.
The color touch screen display is very easy to read and find what I need.
Having 2 enclosed paper trays is also handy, to be able to keep 2 different papers at the ready.
I look forward to putting the scanner through its paces to scan a lot of the backlog of old paperwork.",4 years ago
850,851,5732906,lilxerin,5,Excellent Printer!,"I absolutely love this printer! From the easy unpacking from the box to all of its wonderful capabilities. First off, this printer was so easy to remove from the box. The printer was in a clear plastic bag that had handles, so that when you lifted the bag, the whole printer and its components came out in one try. The setup was very easy. There was a paper included that told you step by step instructions on how to set up the printer. 
 The printer is not small at all, but it is the same size as most all in one's. It has a nice sized touchscreen that shows all the settings to copy, fax, print, and scan. It has 2 trays that hold 500 sheets of paper. I love this so that I don't have to keep reloading paper all the time. It has wifi so that you can hook up your computers, even if they are not in the same room. It prints super fast. It has 4 ink cartridges that were very easy to install. It has a auto document feeder so that you can copy or scan very fast. I have yet to use the fax other than the test fax it does, but I am sure this feature works nicely. The only thing it lacks is that it doesn't show who is calling on the screen which is a feature I had on my previous printer. Other than that, this printer is everything it promises to be. Amazing product and I can't wait to use it to it's full capacity.

851,852,5732906,sunshine52,5,Epson Work Force Pro WF-4740,"I love this printer it is awesome. The first printer I have ever owned that is wireless.

Print quality is better than any printer I have ever owned. I really like the paper trays and the touch screen. I am recommending this printer to all my family and friends. I have not found anything that I do not like about this printer. I have owned many printers and so far this is my favorite.
 I do not have a land line to use the fax but I am sure it is easy to set up and use as well. I love the fact that you do not have to have wires connected and can place this printer across the room or where ever you need to put it. It is a very nice printer and a nice size.

852,853,5732906,ShirleyJ,4,Easy but not exact,"I read the review before I purchased this and I was surprised how at easy this was to set up, EXCEPT the scanning. The scan option on the printer menu does not find my computer, even though I have printed from my computer. I tried all of the options to fix this, except calling some one. The option presented itself when I pressed the WSD option. (I didn't know what the letters stood for), then a Windows Fax and Scan came up and I was able to scan and save it.  I was also able to import from my photo program.  The saddest part is I print a lot of photos and it made a complete mess of trying to print on glossy pater. I tried it more than once. It just blobbed the ink on so I couldn't tell what I printed. I will now have to purchase a photo printer. It did print a great photo on plain paper so it could still be used for flyers, etc.",4 years ago

One of the great features of this product is the touch screen which has the same technology as my iPhone. I'm able to slide and advance to next screens with ease. Another positive is the noise of this printer. Very, Very, quiet especially with it's lightning speed printing of documents.

855,856,5732906,mptacek,5,Epson knocks it out of the park again,"I honestly wasn’t expecting to be impressed when I was offered to beta test the Epson WF-4740, as I already had a multi-function printer at home that I liked. I’m glad to say I was wrong! I had about two weeks to put the machine through its paces, so I haven’t done extensive testing but so far it’s been great. Here’s why: - Build quality is solid. This is a heavy printer, to the extent that, when I saw the unpacking instructions want you to pull the printer out of the box using plastic bag handles, I thought the bag would split due to the weight of the printer (fortunately it did not). It was also securely packed, and all loose or moveable components were attached with so much blue tape I could probably build a Smurf. No wussy, creaky plastic pieces here. The ink cartridges were both taped and vacuum sealed to keep them from leaking or drying out.

- Set up was pretty easy. I used the quick-start guide and was able to get the test print pages going within a few minutes. Wifi setup was decent; the first time the software on my PC thought the wifi setup had failed (likely a timeout issue) but running it a second time resolved it. I was able to print from my iPhone directly as an AirPrint device within minutes of connecting the printer to my home wifi

- Two thumbs up on the print quality. It’s inkjet, so don’t expect laser print quality, but it’s not far off and doesn’t scream “this will run in the rain” like a lot of older inkjet technology. Colors on plain paper are completely usable (so you can print a lot of cat pictures and stick them to your fridge) and when I used glossy photo paper, I was solidly impressed. The colors popped and the black was not greyed-out

- Noise level is fairly low (the cats did not panic when the printer started) though, being inkjet, you will hear cartridge carrier and paper advance noise. Once you’re done printing, you may head a little additional noise, which I believe is the ink cartridge carrier resetting and/or self-cleaning.

- Scanning worked flawlessly, even at 1200dpi (which would cause my other multi-function printer to throw errors). Speed to scan is good, and color representation is clear. The interface is nice and simple as well, asking you just the right questions (what are you scanning, where do you want to save the file, what do you want to name it, what the scan dpi is, etc).

- The control panel is great! It’s honestly a relief to not have to squint at a tiny non-backlit monochrome display to determine what mode I’m in and what the printer is trying to tell me. The icons are unique enough to be fairly self-explanatory, and the fact that the console pivots means you can view it easily whether it’s at eye level or higher / lower when you’re using it.

Some things to know: -Printer does not come with a USB or Ethernet cable, but you probably have a shoebox full of both at home should you decide not to use it as a wireless printer - The ink cartridges are starter ones, but the estimates are about 450-500 pages, so you’ll still be able to print a lot of cat pictures before worrying about ordering the standard or XL cartridges as a refill. - Control panel has beeps turned on by default, which is a tad annoying, but the menu option to turn off the sounds is fairly easy to locate - The second paper tray does specify “plain paper only” so if you’re printing glossy photos, use the top tray

I did not have a chance to test the fax functions (no landline at home anymore), or the “print from USB” feature, though I expect to play with that over the next few weeks. Overall, if I was looking for a new color multi-function printer, this would be a very strong contender.

856,857,5732906,Jaticeo,5,Great Printer !!,"As I received my package from FedEx, I noticed it was in the latest box design from Epson, it seems very informative for the us consumer about its features which as you know when going out to buy something and don’t have time to the research the box is your only guide and it has plenty of information on all four sides and top of the box. Just the box, alone will help you decide if you want to buy it.it seems to have quite a few good features, here are a few of them it's wireless, it prints, scans and faxes and can also be used with an ethernet RJ45 connection, it supposed to print above laser quality, claims to print 900 pages on using just black Epson 802 ink and 2600 pages with the larger 802XL ink cartridge. color printing it claims to print 650 pages with 802 ink set and 1900 with the 802XL cartriges.it prints 24 pages per minute black and 22 pages per minute in color, it also features double sided printing which in my opinion is a great feature to have in a printer especially with a small business, scan resolution 1200 x 2400dp/ppp, it also features a large LCD Screen 4.3 inches, it uses Epson's PrecisisonCore ink which is economical, durable, and has great resolution, now to the unboxing. 
The box is easy to open with scissors or letter opener, As I opened the box I see on top the packet with congratulation letter on selecting this product, Installation CD, manual, and quick setup guides. I must say the packet was in a very durable Ziploc bag which to me means they put a lot of attention in to packaging also to protect the contents when storing them, the printer itself was in a durable bag as well with handles for easy removal from box. but you still require some help to Take It Out. once you remove the bag and you are automatically impressed by its look, you must remove a lot of blue stabilizing tape which is what I call it. make sure you get all of it before you set it up. Under the top scanner feeder tray there you will find another packet with standard T802 ink. I made sure to have access to all doors and compartments before proceeding. and now the setup.

 For the setup 
you must have a CD-ROM, a usb cord, and if you are going to use the wired option you need the following a standard ethernet (RJ45) wire. Which is not provided. Setup for a person like me was very easy but for the average person it could be a little tricky, here’s why some laptops, like mine don’t have a CD-ROM drive.so here is the method I used to set it up which was still quite easy, since I am going the wireless route, I went to the Epson support site and downloaded the installation file to my laptop and proceeded by clicking on the install file But before that you need to use that usb cable I told you about earlier so the pc and the printer can communicate during the setup process all you do is follow the prompts which will include installing the ink also fairly easy just remember to shake each cartage 5 times before putting it in the printer , it will also do a firmware update which can take up to 10 min depending on your internet speed and its sets itself up. I thought it was simple. At the end, it will ask you to register. Now once it is set up. And you will be amazed with the speed and the quality of the test page. I highly recommend this printer. Best Epson printer I’ve had to date.by the way you can also set it up stand alone, wirelessly through the control center itself on the printer but it does require you know your SSID and password for your router. My only concern was the lack of media for people without a cd drive, the folding out of the output tray extender can sometimes be annoying depending on the angle of the control center (LCD Touch screen).

857,858,5732906,Coch3se,5,Very happy,"Unpacking was easy. Helpfull handles on the bag allowed easy removal from the box. After removing all of the blue tape I plugged in my ethernet and power cable. After powering on the printer the screen guides you on how to install the ink cartridges. While the printer was charging the cartridges I downloaded the newest software package from epsons web site https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/WorkForce-Series/Epson-WorkForce-Pro-WF-4740/s/SPT_C11CF75201 . I opted to manually set up a static IP on my network but the software had the option to automatically set it up for me and printed my first test page. After everything was good an automatic firmware update was installed. So far so good except that there are no photo paper samples included.

I have been using this printer for my small drafting business and have been printing a large amount of text and black and white line drawings. This printer is faster and more crisp than my old laser. Regarding color I printed a few snaps from my phone using the Epson iPrint android app. Again I am extremely happy with the output. All you have to do is select the photos you want to print pick your options and hit print. The scanner is a scanner and does a great job at what it is supposed to do. I have included two color and B/W images printed and scanned with this printer.

All In all I have had no problems with this printer and I am very happy with its output quality and speed.

Also when a paper jam occurs and you are trying to scan you have to shut down the printer because for some reason I can end it on my pc but the printer just keeps trying to close it.  Lastly and maybe I just haven't figured out how to do this but with my old printer I could scan several items of different sizes of paper and lay them on the glass to do this, with this printer it wants to save them individually by page.",4 years ago
